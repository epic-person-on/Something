(S1)Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. Actually, it's quite good on toast. Back, back beast, back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run away. Yeah! And stay out. Wanted. Fairytale creatures. Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give me that. Your fine days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Come on. Sit down there! And be quiet! This cage is so small. You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please, give me another chance. Oh, shut up! Next. What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy. Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. No! Please, don't let them do it! Next. What do you got? Well, I've got a talking donkey! Right. Well that's good for ten schillings, if you can prove it. Oh, go ahead fella. Well? He's just a li..., just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. You boneheaded donkey! That's it. I have heard enough. Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I can talk. I love to talk. I've talked to... Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He can fly! He can talk! -That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey! You might have seen house fly, maybe even a superfly. But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly! Seize him! Get him! This way! Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the order of lord Farquaad. I am authorized to place you both under arrest. And transport you to designated resettlement facility. Oh really? You and what army? Can I say something to you? Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible. Are you talking to... ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards. They thought that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. Oh, that's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? But I... I don't have any friends. And I'm not going out there by myself. Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea... I'll stick with you. You and me in green fighting machine. Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary. Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you definitively need some tic-tac or something, 'cause your breath stinks! Man you've ??? my note! Just like the time... ...and then I ate some rotten berries. Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day. Why are you following me? I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm all alone, there is no one here, beside me. My problems have all gone. There's no one to derive me. But you got to have free ... -Stop singing! Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at me! What am I? A... ...really tall? No! I'm an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and pitchforks. Doesn't that bother you? Nope. Really? -Really really. Oh? Man, I like you. What's your name? A..., Shrek. Shrek?! But do you know, what I like about you, Shrek? You've got that kind of: "I don't care what nobody thinks of me" thing. I like that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right. Uh, look at that. Who would wanna live in a place like that? That would be my home. Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful. You know you're quite a decorator. It's amazing what you did with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess, you don't entertain much, do you? I like my privacy. You know I do to. That's another thing, we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You try to give them a hint and they won't leave. And then there's that big occurred silence, you know? Can I stay with you? -What? Can I stay with you, please. Of course! -Really? No. -Please! I don't want to go back there. You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak. Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick together! You got to let me stay! Please! Please! OK, OK. -But one night only. -Huh, thank you! A, what are you do... No! This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories. And in 
the morning... I'm making waffles. Where do I sleep? Outside! Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know, I don't know you and you don't know me... ... so I guess, outside is best for me. Here I go. Good night. I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside. Sit by myself outside, I guess. I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me. -I thought, I told you to stay outside. -I am outside. Well James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have? It's not... What a lovely bed. -Got you! I found some cheese. Awful stuff. -Is that you Gordon? -How did you know? Enough! What are you doing in my house? Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table! Where would we supposed to put her. The bed's taken. What? I live in a swamp. I've put up signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre! What do I have to do, to get a little privacy? Oh, no! No, no! What are you doing in my swamp? All right, get out of here. All of you. Move it! Come on, let's go. And hurry up, hurry up. No, no, not there. Not there! Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them. Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What? We were forced to come here. -By who? Lord Farquaad. He ??? All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? Oh I do. I know where he is. Does anyone else know where to find him? -Anyone at all? -Me. -Anyone? Oh pick me, I know! Me, me. Ok, fine. Attention all fairy tale things! Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially warned up. In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get all off my land and back where you came from. You. You're coming with me. All right. That's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city adventure. I love it. I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek! I'm on road again... What did I say about singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Well, can I hummer? -All right. That's enough. He's ready to talk. Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. You monster. I'm not a monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world. -Now tell me! Where are the others? -Eat me. I've tried to be fair to you, creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! -Tell me! Or I'll... -No, no, not the buttons. Not gumdrop buttons. All right! Who's hiding them? Ok, I'll tell you. -Do you know the muffin-man? -The muffin-man? -The muffin-man. -Yes, I know the muffin-man. Who lives on Proully lane? -Well, she's married to the muffin-man. -The muffin-man! -The muffin-man! -She's married to the muffin-man. My lord! We found it. Well then, what are you waiting for? Bring it in. Magic mirror. Don't tell him anything! Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? Well, technically, you're not a king. A..., felonious. -You were saying. -What I mean is a... ...you're not a king, yet. But you can become one. All you have to do, is marry a princess. Go on. So, just sit back and relax my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are. Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shading from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters. Please welcome... Cinderella. Bachelorette number two is a kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy. Although she lives with seven other man, she is not easy. Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and find out what a live wife she is. Come on. Give it up for... Show-white. And last but certainly not least. Bachelorette number three is a fire-breathing ????, dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes Pina Coladas and getting cut in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona. So will it be, bachelorette number one? Bachelorette number two? Or bachelorette number three? -Two... -Three! -Two! One. No, no, no. Three. Pick number three my lord. Ok, ok. Number three. Lord Farquaad. You've chosen... princess Fiona. She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone... But I probably should mention little thing that happens at night... -I'll do it! -Yes, but after sunset... Silence! I will make this princess Fiona my queen. And Duloc will finally have the perfect king! Captain! Assemble your finest man. We're going to have a tournament! That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc. I've told you I'll find it. So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle. Aha, that's the place. Do you think maybe he's compensating for something. Hey, hey wait up Shrek! -Hey, you! -No, no! Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just... It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody? Hey look at this. Wow! -Let's do that again. -No. no. All right. You're going the right way for smack bottom. Sorry about that. That champion should have the honor, no, no... ...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first 
runner up will take his place. And so on, and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. Applause. Let the tournament begin. What is that? Ugh, it's hideous. Oh, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. Indeed. Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named champion. How about him. Oh, hey. Now, come on. Can't we just settle this over a pint? No? All right then. Come on. Hey Shrek! Let me, let me! The chair! Give him the chair! Thank you. Thank you, very much. I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel! Shall I give the order sir? No. I have a better idea. People of Duloc. I give you our champion! What? Congratulation, Ogre. You've won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. Quest? I'm already on a quest. A quest to get my swamp back! -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairytale creatures. Indeed. All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me and I'll give you your swamp back. Exactly the way it was? Down to the last slime covered toast tool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. What kind of quest? Ok, let me get this straight! We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it with full of freaks on the first place. -Is that about right? -You know what? Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk. I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them? You know, ??? . Grab his bones to make you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick. Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate. Got a knife, cut open their spleens and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? A, no, not really, no. For your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think. -Example. -Example? OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions. -They stink? -Yes, no. -O, they make you cry. -No. Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start ??? little wild hairs? No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. O, you both have layers. You know not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers. I don't care what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. You know what else everyone likes? Paffe. Have you ever met a person and you say: "Hey, let's get some paffe" and they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious. No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden. Ogres are like onions. End of story. Bye, bye. See you lather. Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. You know I think I've preferred your humming. Do you have a tissue or something, 'cause I'm making a mess. Just the word paffe has made me start slimying Why, Shrek, did you do that? Man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was opened and everything. Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. It's brimstone. We must be getting close. Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking ??? brimstone. I know what I smell and ??? no brimstone. And they don't come of stone neither. Sure it's big enough, but look at the location. Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogres have layers? Oh, yeah. Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear ??? sleeves. Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. -You know what I mean. -Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs. No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava! Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok? For emotional support. We'll just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time. -Really? -Really really. Ok. That makes me feel so much better. Just keep moving and don't look down. Don't look down, don't look down. Shrek! I'm looking down! I can't do this. Just let me off right now, please. -But you're already half way. -Yeah, but I know that half is safe. Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back. Shrek, no, wait. Don't do that! Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? -Oh. This? -Yes, that! Yes, yes. Do it. OK. -No, Shrek! -I'm doing it. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. That will do Donkey, that will do. Cool. So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway? Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her. I was talking about the dragon Shrek. -Are you afraid? -No, but shhhhh. Oh, good. Me neither. Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid. Here's a..., something responsible of the situation. Not to mention dangerous situation. And there's dragon that breathes fire. I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, but they're scare. You know what I mean. I'm sure he's heavier than a cow... Donkey. Two things. Ok? Shut, up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs. Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess. The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. What makes you think she'll be there? I read it 
in a book once. Cool. You handle the dragon, I'll handle the stairs. Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll ???. That's right. Those stairs won't know which way they go. The drafting stairs, ??? Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I'm master of the stairs. I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I'd step all over it. Well, at least we know where the princess is. -But where is the... -Dragon! Donkey, look out! Got you. Oh, what large teeth you have. I mean, white sparkling teeth. You probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you got there. And do I detect the hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon, 'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out. What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye? Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know I'm a asthmatic and I don't know if we would worked out. You'd be blowing smoke and stuff. Shrek! No, Shrek! Shrek! -Wake up! -What? Are you princess Fiona? I am. Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. Oh, that's nice. Now let's go. But wait, sir knight. This be our first meeting. Should not be wonderful, romantic moment? Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time. Hey, what are you doing? You know, you should sweep me out of my feet. Out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed. You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? Uh-um. But we have to sing through this moment. You can residing of a poem to me. A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something. I don't think so. Well, can I at least know a name of my champion? Shrek. So, Shrek. I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. Thanks. -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's not my job to do this. Now, come on! But this isn't right. ??? That's what all the other knights did. Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame. That's not the point. Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there. Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you? One of a kind. ...rush into a physical relationship. I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude. That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude. Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and take this one step at the time. I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying. As friends, maybe even as ??? Hey don't do that. That's my tail. That's ma personal tail. And you're going to tear it off.... Oh, no. No! -It talks?! -Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick. Ok, you two. Head for the exit. I'll take care of the dragon. Ruuuuun! You did it. You rescued me. Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a ... ...a little unorthodox I admit, but by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt. And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed. I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She thinks I'm a steed. The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight. -Aah, no. -Why not? I have helmet hair. Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer. Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust. But, how will you kiss me? What? That wasn't in a job description. -Maybe it's a perk? -No. It's destiny. You must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight. And then they share true love's first kiss. With Shrek? You think, wait... ...you think Shrek is your true love? Well, yes. You think that Shrek is your true love. What is so funny? Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok? Of course you are. You're my rescuer. Now, now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not going to. -Take it off! -No! -Now! -Ok, easy. As you command your highness. You're an Ogre. Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. Well, yes, actually. Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre. Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok? He's the one, who wants to marry you. Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me? Good question. You should ask him that, when we get there. But I have to be rescued by my true love. Not by some Ogre and his pet. Well so much for noble steed. Look princess. You're not making my job any easier. Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right? -I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare. -You coming donkey? -Put me down! Yeah, I'm right behind you. Put me down or you will suffer the consequences. This is not dignified. Put me down. Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her, that way. Now, how you let her down real easy, so her feelings aren't hurt? But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. How do you do this? Just tell her, she's not your true love. Everyone knows it what happens when you 
find... Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better. Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. It's beautiful. And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. What's he like? Well, let me put it this way, princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him. Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad. Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow Tomorrow? It will take that long? -Shouldn't we stop to make camp? -No. That would take longer. We can keep going. But there are robbers in the woods. Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is definitely something that sounds good. Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything we're gonna see in this forest. I need to find somewhere to camp, now! Hey, over here. Shrek, we can do better than that. Now, I don't think this is decent for princess. No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. Homey touches? Like what? A door. Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night. Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 'cause I will... I said good night! Shrek! What are you doing? I just..., you know... Oh, come on, I was just kidding. And that one, that's Throwback. The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future form these stars? Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look. There's Blodna, the "Flatulent" You can guess what he is famous for. All right. Now I know you're making this up. No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters running away from his stag. Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots. You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Forget it. Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway? -Our swamp? -You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff. We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our. There's just me and my swamp. And the first thing I'm gonna do, is build a ten foot wall around my land. You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now. You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out. No, do you think? -Are you hiding something? -Never mind Donkey. Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it? No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things. -Why don't you want to talk about it? -Why do you want to talk about it? -Oh, Why you block? -I'm not blocking. -Oh yes you are. -Donkey, I'm warning you. -Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who? Everyone, ok? -Oh, now we're getting somewhere. -Oh, for 'the love of pit'. Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do you got against the whole world anyway? Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go: AAA... Help! Run! A big stupid ugly Ogre. They judge me, before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone. You know what? When we met, I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre. Yeah, I know. So, a... Are there any donkeys up there? Well, there's a Cabby. The small and annoying. Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there. That one, over there? That's the moon. Again. Show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. Perfect. Yeah. You know I like like that. Oh come on baby... -Donkey. Wake up. -What? -Wake up. Morning. How do you like your eggs? -Good morning princess. -What's all this about? You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me. Thanks. Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. -Shrek! -What? It's a compliment. Better out than in I always say. But that's no way to behave in front of a princess. -Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are. You know. You're not exactly what I've expected. Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them. Princess! What are you doing? ???mon shery, for I am your saviour. And I am rescuing you from this green...beast. Hey! That's my princess. Go find your own. Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here? Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are. Oh, of course. How rude that was. Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men! Man, that was annoying. Oh, you little... Shall we? ???all the forin??? Whoa, hold on, now. Where did that come from? -What? -That. Back there. That was amazing. Where did you learn that? Well, when one lives alone one has to learn these things in case there's a... There is an arrow in your butt. What? Oh, would you look at that. Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. -What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt! -Oh, no. Shrek's going to die. -Donkey, I'm ok. You can't do this to me Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep your legs elevated. Turn your head ???. -Does anyone 
know how to handle... -Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! -Donkey! -Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. -What are the flowers for? -For getting rid of the Donkey. Now, you hold still and I'll yank this thing out. -Hey! Easy with the yanking. -I'm sorry, but it has to come out. No, no. It's tender. What you're doing here is the opposite... -Don't move. -Ok, look. Time out. -Would you... Ok. What do you propose we do? Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming! Not good. Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it. Nothing happened. We were just a... Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok? Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just... Au! Hey, what's that? Is that... There it is, princess. -Your future awaits you. -That's Duloc? Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a I guess we better move on. Sure, but Shrek... -I'm worried about Donkey. -What? I mean. Look at him. He doesn't look so good. -What are you talking about? I'm fine. -Well, that's what they always say. And the next thing you know you're on your back. -Dead! -You know she's right. You look awful. -Do you want to sit down? -You know, I'll make you up some tea. Well, I won't say nothing, but I've got this twinge in my neck. And if I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see? -He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood. Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs. I don't have any thumbs!!! I think I need a hug. This is good. This is really good. -What is this? -Wheat rat. -Rotisserie style. -No kidding. -Oh, this is delicious. -Well, they also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean wheat rat stew. I guess I'll be dining a little different late tomorrow night. Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you. Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it. I'd like that. -Ah... , princess? -Yes, Shrek? I'm a.... I was wondering. Are you... a... Are you gonna eat that? Man, isn't this romantic. Just look at that sunset. Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late. -What? -Wait a minute. I see what's going on here. You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you? Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified. You know I'll better go inside. But don't feel bad, princess. I used to be afraid of the dark too. Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark. -Good night. -Good night. Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here. Oh, what are you talking about. Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look, I'm an animal and I got instincts. And I know that you two are digging on each other. I can feel it. Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones. Just go in there and tell her how you feel. There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know. I'm not saying that I do, 'cause I don't. She's a princess and I'm... ...an Ogre. Yeah, an Ogre. -Hey, where are you going? -To get more firewood. Princess. Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess? It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games. -No, no. -Help! Shrek! Shrek! -No. -Shrek! -It's ok. It's ok. -What did you do with the princess? -Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess. -It's me, in this body. -Oh my god. You ate the princess. -Can you hear me? -Donkey! Listen, keep breathing. I'll get you out of there! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! This is me. Princess? What happened to you? You're a... different. -I'm ugly, ok? -Yeah. Was it something that you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea. -You are what you eat, I say. -No. I've been this way as long as I can remember. What do you mean? Look, I've never seen you like this before. It only happens when the sun goes down. By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find true love's first kiss. Then, take love's true form... -Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry. -It's the spell. When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible ugly beast. I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this? All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24/7. But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this is not how a princess is meant to look. Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad? I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell. But you know, 
you're kind of an Ogre. And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common. Shrek? Princess, I... How is it going first of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty. And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it, because you're pretty. But I like you anyway. A.... I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go. Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love. Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell. Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth. No, no. You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know. What's the point of being unable to talk? You got to keep secrets. Promise you won't tell. Promise! You know, before this is over, I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies. All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. Look at my eye twitching. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. I tell him not. I tell him! Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want ... Shrek. Are you all right? Perfect. Never been better. I... There's something I have to tell you. You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night. -You've heard what I said? -Every word. I thought you'd understand? Oh, I understand! Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast! -I thought that wouldn't matter to you. -Yeah, well, it does. Ah, right on time. Princess. I brought you a little something. What I missed? What I missed? -Princess Fiona. -As promised. Now hand it over. Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp. Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go. Before I change my mind. Forgive me princess for startling you, but you startled me. For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before. -I am lord Farquaad. -Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for I was just saying short... farewell. Oh. That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre. -It's not like it has feelings. -No. You're right. It doesn't. Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona, I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom? Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make... Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd... No! I mean I... Why wait? Let's get married today. Before sunset. Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do. There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests... Captain! Round up some guests. Farewell Ogre. Shrek, what are you doing? You let her get away. -Yeah, so what. -Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know. -I talked to her last night. She's... -Yeah I know you talked to her last night. You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such good friend, why didn't you follow her home? -Shrek. I want to go with you. -I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! -But. I thought... -Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong. Shrek. Donkey? What are you doing? I was thinking of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one. Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp. Not through it. It is around your half. See? That's your half and this is my half. Oh, your half? Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head -Back off! -No. You back off! -This is my swamp. -Our swamp. -Let go, Donkey! -You let go! -Stubborn jackass. -Smelly Ogre. Fine! Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you, yet. -Well, I'm through with you! -Well, you know. You were always me, me, me. Well, guess what? Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me, you insult me, you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away. Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? Because that's what friend do. They forgive each other! Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. I forgive you for stabbing me in the back! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy. You're afraid of your own feelings. -Go away. -See? There you are, doing it again. Just like you did it to Fiona. And all she ever do, was like you. Maybe even love you. Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature. -I heard that you two were talking. -She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about... ...somebody else. She wasn't talking about me? Well then, who was she talking about? No way, I'm not saying anything. You won't listen to me, right? Right? -Donkey. -No! Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre. Can you forgive me? -Hey, that's the friends are for, right? -Right. -Friends? -Friends. So? What did Fiona said about me? Why are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her. The wedding! We'll never make it in 
time! Never fear! For where there is a will, there is a way. And I have I way. Donkey? -I guess this is just my act of magnetism. -Oh, come here, you. All right. All right. Don't get all started. No one likes kissass. All right, hop on. Hold on tight. I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet. People of Duloc. We gather here today to bear witness to reunion of our new king... Excuse me. Could you just skip ahead to "I do's"? Go on. Go ahead and have some fun, if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait a minute. You want to do this right, don't you? -What are you talking about? -It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for. The priest is going to say: "Speak now or forever hold your peace". And that's where you say: "I object". -I don't have time for this. -Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you? -Yes. -You want to hold her! -Yes. -Please her! -Yes! Then you got to, got to try a little tender love. -The chicks love that romantic crap. -All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line? We got to check it out. And as so by the power of these two... What do you see? -I now pronounce you... -There they go! -...he all ready said it. -Oh, for 'the love of pit'. I object! Shrek? Oh, now what does he want? Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you? I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean. -What are you doing here? -Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you. But showing up uninvited to a wedding... -Fiona! I need to talk to you. -Oh, now you wanna talk? Well it's a little late for that. So if you'll excuse me. -But you can't marry him! -And why not? Because, because he's just marrying you so he can be king. -Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him. -He's not your true love. -What do you know about true love? -Well, I ...I'm in... Oh, this is precious. The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess. Laugh. Shrek. Is this true? Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me! By night one way, by day another. I wanted to show you before. Well. That explains a lot. Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. I order you to get them out of my sight. -Now! Get them! Get them, both! -No! This marriage is minding, and that makes me king. See? See? -Shrek! -No. -Don't just stand there, you dogs. -Get out of my way. No! Shrek! -And as for you my wife. -Fiona! I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I will have order. I will have potential. I will have... All right, nobody move! I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it. I'm a donkey on the edge! Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? Go ahead Shrek. -Fiona? -Yes, Shrek? I love you. Really? Really, really. I love you too. A time for true love's first kiss... Fiona? Fiona? Are you all right? Yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful. But you are beautiful. I was hoping this would be a happy ending. God bless us, everyone.

(S2)INT. CASTLE INTERIOR 1
There is a bed onstage behind a silky curtain, backlit.
PRINCE CHARMING (OS)
Once upon a time in a kingdom far,
far away, the king and queen were
blessed with a beautiful baby girl.
And throughout the land, everyone
was happy... until the sun went down
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment
that took hold each and every night.
Desperate, they sought the help of a
fairy godmother who had them lock
the young princess away in a tower,
there to await the kiss... of the
handsome Prince Charming.
(enters gallantly onstage)
It was he who would chance the
perilous journey through blistering
cold and scorching desert traveling
for many days and nights, risking
life and limb to reach the Dragon's
keep. For he was the bravest, and
most handsome... in all the land.
(looks at the audience)
And it was destiny that his kiss
would break the dreaded curse. He
alone would climb to the highest
room of the tallest tower to enter
the princess's chambers, cross the
room to her sleeping silhouette,
pull back the gossamer curtains to
find her...
(pulls back the curtain to
reveal WOLF in the bed.
Gasps)
WOLF
What?
CHARMING
Princess... Fiona?
WOLF
No!
CHARMING
(relieved)
Thank heavens. Where is she?
2.
WOLF
She's on her honeymoon.
CHARMING
Honeymoon? With whom?
2 EXT. THE SWAMP 2
SHREK
It's so good to be home! Just you
and me and...
DONKEY
(offstage)
One is the loneliest number that you
ever do...
(enters)
Two can be as bad as one...
SHREK
Donkey?
DONKEY
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two a sight
for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine. And look at
you, Mrs. Shrek. How 'bout a side of
sugar for the steed?
SHREK
Donkey, what are you doing here?
DONKEY
Taking care of your love nest for
you.
SHREK
Oh, you mean like... sorting the
mail and watering the plants?
DONKEY
Yeah, and feeding the fish!
SHREK
I don't have any fish.
DONKEY
You did.
(looks around for the
fish)
SHREK
3.
Look at the time. I guess you'd
better be going.
DONKEY
Don't you want to tell me about your
trip? Or how about a game of
Parcheesi?
FIONA
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?
DONKEY
Oh, yeah, that. I don't know. She's
been all moody and stuff lately. I
thought I'd move in with you.
FIONA
You know we're always happy to see
you, Donkey.
SHREK
But Fiona and I are married now. We
need a little time, you know, to be
together. Just with each other.
Alone.
DONKEY
Say no more. You don't have to worry
about a thing. I will always be here
to make sure nobody bothers you.
SHREK
Donkey!
DONKEY
Yes, roomie?
SHREK
You're bothering me.
DONKEY
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch
a tournament, anyway, so...Maybe
I'll see y'all Sunday for a barbecue
or something.
SHREK
He'll be fine. Now, where were we?
(giggles)
Oh.I think I remember. Donkey!
DONKEY
4.
I know, I know! Alone! I'm going!
I'm going. What do you want me to
tell these other guys?
ROYAL MESSENGER enters to fanfare.
MESSENGER
(clears throat)
"Dearest Princess Fiona. You are
hereby summoned to the Kingdom of
Far, Far Away for a royal ball in
celebration of your marriage at
which time the King will bestow his
royal blessing... upon you and
your...uh... Prince Charming. Love,
the King and Queen of Far, Far Away.
aka Mom and Dad."
FIONA
Mom and Dad?
SHREK
Prince Charming?
DONKEY
Royal ball? Can I come?
SHREK
We're not going.
FIONA & DONKEY
What?
SHREK
I mean, don't you think they might
be a bit...shocked to see you like
this?
FIONA
Well, they might be a bit surprised.
But they're my parents, Shrek. They
love me. And don't worry. They'll
love you, too.
SHREK
Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think
I'll be welcome at the country club.
FIONA
Stop it. They're not like that.
SHREK
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?
5.
FIONA
Oh, come on! You could at least give
them a chance.
SHREK
To do what? Sharpen their
pitchforks?
FIONA
No! They just want to give you their
blessing.
SHREK
Oh, great. Now I need their
blessing?
FIONA
If you want to be a part of this
family, yes!
SHREK
Who says I want to be part of this
family?
FIONA
You did! When you married me!
SHREK
Well, there's some fine print for
you!
FIONA
(exasperated sigh)
So that's it. You won't come?
SHREK
Trust me. It's a bad idea. We are
not going! And that's final!
ALL exit.

Buy 'em drinks! Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard! Rawhide! Yeehaw!

No!
DONKEY
Are we there yet?
SHREK
(mimics)
Are we there yet?
DONKEY
That's not funny. That's really
immature.
SHREK
That's not funny. That's really
immature.
DONKEY
This is why nobody likes ogres.
SHREK
This is why nobody likes ogres.
DONKEY
Your loss!
SHREK
Your loss!
DONKEY
I'm gonna just stop talking.
SHREK
Finally!
DONKEY
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or
nothing!
SHREK
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away,
Donkey. That's where we're going.
Far, far --

This is it.

SHREK
(chuckles)
So...you still think this was a good
idea?
FIONA
Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look
happy to see us.
KING
Who on earth are they?
QUEEN
I think that's our little girl.
KING
That's not little! That's a really
big problem. Wasn't she supposed to
kiss Prince Charming and break the
spell?
QUEEN
9.
Well, he's no Prince Charming, but
they do look...
SHREK
Happy now? We came. We saw them. Now
let's go before they light the
torches.
FIONA
They're my parents.
SHREK
Hello? They locked you in a tower.
FIONA
That was for my own...
KING
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not
home.
QUEEN
Harold, we have to be...
SHREK
Quick! While they're not looking we
can make a run for it.
FIONA
Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna
be...
KING
A disaster! There is no way...
FIONA
You can do this.
Both parties begin moving toward eachother
SHREK
I really...
KING
Really...
QUEEN
don't...
SHREK
want...
FIONA
10.
to...
KING
be...
SHREK
Here!
FIONA
Mom... Dad...I'd like you to meet my
husband... Shrek.
SHREK
Well, um...It's easy to see where
Fiona gets her good looks from.
(chuckles nervously)
5 DONKEY ENTERS SHAKING OFF A GUARD 5
DONKEY
(off-stage)
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I
am.
(enters)
What's happening, everybody? Thanks
for waiting. I had the hardest time
getting into this place.
KING
No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Go!
FIONA
No, Dad! It's all right. It's all
right. He's with us. He helped
rescue me from the dragon.
DONKEY
That's me: the noble steed.
SHREK
Oh, boy.
QUEEN
So, Fiona, tell us about where you
live.
FIONA
Well...Shrek owns his own land.
Don't you, honey?
SHREK
11.
Oh, yes! It's in an enchanted forest
abundant in squirrels and cute
little duckies and...
DONKEY
(laughing)
What? I know you ain't talking about
the swamp.
KING
An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How
original.
QUEEN
I suppose that would be a fine place
to raise the children.
6 SHREK AND KING COUGH INVOLUNTARILY 6
SHREK
It's a bit early to be thinking
about that, isn't it?
KING
Indeed.
QUEEN
Harold!
SHREK
What's that supposed to mean?
FIONA
Dad. It's great, OK?
KING
For his type, yes.
SHREK
My type?
KING
I suppose any grandchildren I could
expect from you would be...
SHREK
Ogres, yes!
QUEEN
Not that there's anything wrong with
that. Right, Harold?
KING
12.
Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is,
assuming you don't eat your own
young!
FIONA
Dad!
SHREK
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!
FIONA
Shrek, please!
KING
I only did that because I love her.
SHREK
Aye, day care or dragon-guarded
castle.
KING
You wouldn't understand. You're not
her father!
QUEEN
Harold!
FIONA
Shrek!
SHREK
Fiona!
KING
Fiona!
FIONA
Mom!

Shush, shush. Now, don't worry. I'm

example, how about a sporty carriage
to ride in style, with a sexy manboy chauffeur named Kyle?
KYLE enters.
FIONA
Thank you very much, Fairy
Godmother, but...
SHREK enters.
SHREK
Fiona? Fiona.
FIONA
Oh, uh...Fairy Godmother... I'd like
you to meet my husband, Shrek.
FG
Your husband? What? What did you
say? When did this happen?
FIONA
Shrek is the one who rescued me.
FG
But that can't be right.
14.
SHREK
Oh, great, more relatives!
FIONA
She's just trying to help.
SHREK
Good! She can help us pack. Get your
coat, dear. We're leaving.
FIONA
What? I don't want to leave. When
did you decide this?
SHREK
Shortly after arriving.
FIONA
Look, I'm sorry...
FG
No, that's all right. I need to go,
anyway. But remember, dear. If you
should ever need me...
happiness...is just a teardrop away.
SHREK
Thanks, but we've got all the
happiness we need. Happy, happy,
happy...
FG
So I see. Let's go, Kyle.
FIONA
Very nice, Shrek.
SHREK
What? I told you coming here was a
bad idea.
FIONA
You could've at least tried to get
along with my father.
SHREK
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing, even if I did want
it.
FIONA
Do you think it might be nice if
somebody asked me what I wanted?
15.
SHREK
Sure. Do you want me to pack for
you?
FIONA
You're unbelievable! You're behaving
like a...
SHREK
Go on! Say it!
FIONA
Like an ogre!
SHREK
Here's a news flash for you! Whether
your parents like it or not...I am
an ogre! And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.
FIONA
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.
(exits)
DONKEY
That's real smooth, Shrek. "I'm an
ogre!"
8 INT. KING AND QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER 8
KING
I knew this would happen.
QUEEN
You should. You started it.
KING
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.
QUEEN
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally. This is
Fiona's choice.
KING
But she was supposed to choose the
prince we picked for her. I mean,
you expect me to give my blessings
to this... thing?
QUEEN
16.
Fiona does. And she'll never forgive
you if you don't. I don't want to
lose our daughter again, Harold. Oh,
you act as if love is totally
predictable. Don't you remember when
we were young? We used to walk down
by the lily pond and...
KING
they were in bloom...
QUEEN
Our first kiss.
KING
It's not the same! I don't think you
realize that our daughter has
married a monster!
QUEEN
Oh, stop being such a drama king.
KING
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!
La, di, da, di, da! Isn't it all
wonderful! I'd like to know how it
could get any worse!
FG
(out on the balcony)
Hello, Harold.
KING gasps.
QUEEN
What happened?
KING
Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade
wound playing up a bit! I'll just
stretch it out here for a while.
FC
We need to talk.
KING
Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to
bed.
(yawns)
Already taken my pills, and they
tend to make me a bit drowsy. So,
how about... we make this a quick
visit. What?
17.
(Bumps up against two
armed guards)
Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha! So, what's new?
FG
You remember my son, Prince
Charming?
CHARMING enters.
KING
Is that you? My gosh! It's been
years. When did you get back?
CHARMING
Oh, about five minutes ago,
actually. After I endured blistering
winds, scorching desert...I climbed
to the highest room in the tallest
tower...
FG
Mommy can handle this. He endures
blistering winds and scorching
desert! He climbs to the highest
bloody room of the tallest bloody
tower...And what does he find? Some
gender-confused wolf telling him
that his princess is already
married.
KING
It wasn't my fault. He didn't get
there in time.
FG
Harold.
(GUARD reaches into his
pocket)
You’ve forced me to do something I
really don't want to do.
KING
(gasps)
What is that? What have you got
there?
GUARD pulls out a cellphone and gives it to FG.
FG
My diet is ruined! Yes, I’d like two
Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili
rings...
18.
CHARMING
I'll have the Medieval Meal.
FG
One Medieval Meal and, Harold...
Curly fries?
KING
No, thank you.
FG
Sourdough soft taco, then?
KING
No, really, I'm fine.
FG
Nothing else thanks.
(hangs up)
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume
you don't want me to go back on my
part.
KING
(sighs deeply)
Indeed not.
FG
So, Fiona and Charming will be
together.
KING
Yes.
FG
Believe me, Harold. It's what's
best. Not only for your
daughter...but for your Kingdom.
KING
What am I supposed to do about it?
FG
Use your imagination.
9 INT. AT A PUB IN THE WOODS 9
KING enters. A woman (UGLY STEPSISTER) is cleaning a glass
with her back to the audience.
KING
(clears throat)
19.
Excuse me. Uh... excuse me. I'm
looking for the Ugly Stepsister.
UGLY STEPSISTER turns around to reveal herself.
KING
Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I
need to have someone taken care of.
UGLY STEPSISTER
Who's the guy?
KING
Well, he's not a guy, per se. Um...
He's an ogre.
UGLY STEPSISTER
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.
There's only one fellow who can
handle a job like that, and,
frankly...he don't like to be
disturbed.
KING
Where could I find him?
UGLY STEPSISTER point to the dark corner of the room.
KING
Hello?
MYSTERIOUS VOICE
Who dares speak to me?
KING
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting,
but I'm told you're the one to talk
to about an ogre problem?
VOICE
You are told correct. But for this,
I charge a great deal of money.
KING
Would... this be enough?
(holds up a heavy satchel
of coins)
VOICE
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty. Just tell me
where I can find this ogre.
20.
10 INT. CASTLE 10
SHREK is alone reading FIONA’s diary.
FIONA (OFFSTAGE)
Dear Diary... Sleeping Beauty is
having a slumber party tomorrow, but
Dad says I can't go. He never lets
me out after sunset. Dad says I'm
going away for a while. Must be like
some finishing school. Mom says that
when I'm old enough, my Prince
Charming will rescue me from my
tower and bring me back to my
family, and we'll all live happily
ever after. Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona
Charming.
A knock on door.
KING
Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting
anything.
SHREK
No, no. I was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.
KING
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.
SHREK
Okay...
KING
I don't know what came over me. Do
you suppose we could pretend it
never happened and start over...
SHREK
Look, Your Majesty, I just...
KING
Please. Call me Dad.
SHREK
Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe
we just need some time to get to
know each other.
KING
21.
Excellent idea! I was actually
hoping you might join me for a
morning hunt. A little father-son
time? I know it would mean the world
to Fiona. Shall we say, by the old
oak?
SHREK
Sure.
FADE OUT:
11 EXT. IN THE FOREST 11
SHREK
Face it, Donkey! We're lost.
DONKEY
We can't be lost. We followed the
King's instructions exactly. "Head
to the darkest part of the
woods...""Past the sinister trees
with scary-looking branches." The
bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
SHREK
We passed that three times already!
DONKEY
You were the one who said not to
stop for directions.
SHREK
Oh, great. My one chance to fix
things up with Fiona's dad and I end
up lost in the woods with you!
DONKEY
Don't get huffy! I'm only trying to
help.
SHREK
I know! I know. I'm sorry, all
right?
DONKEY
Hey, don't worry about it.
SHREK
I just really need to make things
work with this guy.
DONKEY
22.
Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with
Daddy.
SHREK hears purring.
SHREK
Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it
was kind of a tender moment back
there, but the purring?
DONKEY
What? I ain't purring.
SHREK
Sure. What's next? A hug?
DONKEY
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What
do you think I am, some kind of a...
PUSS IN BOOTS enters.
PUSS
Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare!
SHREK
Look! A little cat.
DONKEY
Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
SHREK
It's a cat, Donkey. Come here,
little kitty, kitty. Come on, little
kitty. Come here.
PUSS scratches SHREK’s outstretched hand.
PUSS
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy
from...Puss... in Boots!
SHREK
I'll kill that cat!
PUSS
Ah-ha-ha!
(coughs, wheezes, retches,
coughs, chuckles)
Hairball.
DONKEY
Oh! That is nasty!
23.
SHREK
What should we do with him?
DONKEY
Take the sword and neuter him.
PUSS
Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore
you! It was nothing personal, Señor.
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she is sick. And my
father lives off the garbage! The
King offered me much in gold and I
have a litter of brothers...
SHREK
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona's father
paid you to do this?
PUSS
The rich King? Sí.
SHREK
Well, so much for Dad's royal
blessing.
DONKEY
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.
SHREK
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if I were some sort of Prince
Charming.
PUSS
That's what the King said. Oh, uh...
sorry. I thought that question was
directed at me.
DONKEY
Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything
for her.
SHREK
Well, it's not like I wouldn't
change if I could. I just... I just
wish I could make her happy. Hold
the phone... "Happiness. Just a tear
drop away." Donkey! Think of the
saddest thing that's ever happened
to you!
DONKEY
24.
Aw, man, where do I begin? First
there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic
beans. Then this fool had a party
and he have the guests trying to pin
the tail on me. Then they got drunk
and start beating me with a stick,
going "Piñata!!" What is a piñata,
anyway?
SHREK
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!
DONKEY
Don't go projecting on me. I know
you're feeling bad, but you got to
(Puss steps on his foot)
Aaaahhh! You little, hairy, litterlicking sack of...
KYLE enters with a cart.
KYLE
Fairy Godmother is away from desk or
with a client. But I can help you
with your ‘Happiness problems’
(yawns)
FAIRY GODMOTHER enters and Kyle stands up straight very
quickly.
FG
Kyle, I’ve been looking everywhere
for you! Why aren’t you
(notices SHREK)
What in Grimm's name are you doing
here?
SHREK
Well, um, it seems that Fiona's not
exactly happy.
FG
Oh-ho-ho! And there's some question
as to why that is? Well, let's
explore that, shall we?
Cinderella."Lived happily ever
after." No ogres! Snow White. A
handsome prince. Oh, no ogres.
Sleeping Beauty. No ogres! Hansel
and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. the
Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...No,
no, no! You see, ogres don't live
happily ever after.
25.
SHREK
All right, look, lady!
FG
Don't you point...those dirty green
sausages at me!
KYLE opens the cart to get a soda and SHREK notices the
potions.
SHREK
Ah... that's okay. We’ll go. Very
sorry to have wasted your time, Miss
Godmother.
FG
I need a Monte Cristo Sandwich now.
You’ve got me all worked up.
(exits)
SHREK looks at KYLE, smiles, then knocks him out.
DONKEY
Shrek, are you off your nut?
SHREK
Donkey, quiet and keep watch.
DONKEY
Keep watch? Yeah, I'll keep watch.
I'll watch that wicked witch come
and whammy a world of hurt up your
backside. I'll laugh, too. I'll be
giggling to myself.
SHREK opens the cart and passes potions to PUSS.
PUSS
Toad Stool Softener? Elfa Seltzer?
Hex Lax?
SHREK
Help me find "handsome."
PUSS
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?
SHREK
Well, what does it do?
PUSS
It says "Beauty Divine."
SHREK
26.
That'll have to do. She’s coming
back. Go, Donkey!
ALL exit. FG enters, with CHARMING following after.
FG
What happened here? Kyle! Clean this
up.
CHARMING
Mother!
FG
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.
CHARMING
Whoa, what happened here?
FG
The ogre, that's what!
CHARMING
What? Where is he, Mom? I shall rend
his head from his shoulders! I will
smite him where he stands! He will
rue the very day he stole my kingdom
from me!
FG
Oh, put it away, Junior! You're
still going to be king. We'll just
have to come up with something
smarter.
KYLE
Pardon. Um...Everything is accounted
for, Fairy Godmother, except for one
potion.
FG
What?
(looks in the cart)
Oh...I do believe we can make this
work to our advantage.
12 INT. THE ROYAL CASTLE 12
QUEEN
Try to at least pretend you're
interested in your daughter's
wedding ball.
27.
KING
Honestly, Lillian, I don't think it
matters. How do we know there will
even be a ball?
FIONA
Mom. Dad.
KING
Oh, hello, dear. What's that,
Cedric? Right! Coming.
FIONA
Mom, have you seen Shrek?
QUEEN
I haven't. You should ask your
father. Be sure and use small words,
dear. He's a little slow this
morning.
CEDRIC
Can I help you, Your Majesty?
KING
Ah, yes! Um...Mmm! Exquisite. What
do you call this dish?
CEDRIC
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.
KING
Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on,
Cedric.
FIONA
Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
KING
No, I haven't, dear. I'm sure he
just went off to look for a nice...
mud hole to cool down in. You know,
after your little spat last night.
FIONA
Oh. You heard that, huh?
KING
The whole kingdom heard you. I mean,
after all, it is in his nature to
be…well, a bit of a brute.
FIONA
28.
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.
KING
Well, what did you expect? Look at
what he's done to you.
FIONA
Shrek loves me for who I am. I would
think you'd be happy for me.
KING
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you. Maybe you
should do the same.
13 EXT. FOREST 13
SHREK
(reading the potion)
"Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum
strength. For you and your true
love. If one of you drinks this, you
both will be fine. Happiness,
comfort and beauty divine." You both
will be fine? I guess it means it'll
affect Fiona, too.
DONKEY
Hey, man, this don't feel right. My
donkey senses are tingling all over.
Drop that jug o' voodoo and let's
get out of here.
SHREK
It says, "Beauty Divine." How bad
can it be?
(sniffs the potion and
sneezes)
DONKEY
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction. And if you
think that I'll be smearing Vapor
Rub over your chest, think again!
SHREK
Well, here's to us, Fiona.
DONKEY
Shrek? You drink that, there's no
going back.
29.
SHREK
I know.
DONKEY
No more wallowing in the mud?
SHREK
I know.
DONKEY
No more itchy butt crack?
SHREK
I know!
DONKEY
But you love being an ogre!
SHREK
I know! But I love Fiona more.
DONKEY
Shrek, no! Wait!
SHREK drinks the potion. There’s a long pause then he farts.
DONKEY
I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever
After" potion.
PUSS
Maybe it's a dud.
SHREK
Or maybe Fiona and I were never
meant to be.
Thunder cracks and he passes out
DONKEY
Shrek!
Black out.
FADE IN:
FIONA enters with her luggage.
KING
There you are! We missed you at
dinner. What is it, darling?
FIONA
30.
Dad...I've been thinking about what
you said. And I'm going to set
things right.
KING
Ah! Excellent! That's my girl.
FIONA
It was a mistake to bring Shrek
here. I'm going to go out and find
him. And then we'll go back to the
swamp where we belong.
QUEEN
Fiona, please! Let's not be rash,
darling. You can't go anywhere right
now.
Thunder cracks again and FIONA collapses.
KING
Fiona!
14 INT. IN THE BARN - MORNING 14
SISTER
Good morning, sleepyhead. I love
your kitty!
SHREK
Oh... My head...
SISTER
Here, I fetched a pail of water.
SHREK
Thanks. Uhh!
(sees his reflection in
the pale)
Aahh! A cute button nose? Thick,
wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks?
I'm... I'm...
SISTER
Gorgeous!
(moves in closer)
I'm Jill. What's your name?
SHREK
Um... Shrek.
SISTER
Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?
31.
SHREK looks around confused.
SISTER
You're tense. I want to rub your
shoulders.
SHREK
Have you seen my donkey?
DONKEY enters and begins studying SHREK, followed by PUSS.
DONKEY
Wow! That's some quality potion,
Shrek! What's in that stuff?
PUSS
"Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping.
Not intended for heart patients or
those with... nervous disorders."
SHREK
What?
PUSS
Señor? "To make the effects of this
potion permanent, the drinker must
obtain his true love's kiss by
midnight."
SHREK
Midnight?
DONKEY
Why is it always midnight?
SISTER
Pick me! I'll be your true love!
SHREK
Look, lady, I already have a true
love.
SISTER
Oh...
PUSS
Take it from me, Boss. You are going
to have one satisfied Princess.
DONKEY
And let's face it. Even though you
are a lot easier on the eyes, inside
you're the same old mean, salty...
32.
SHREK
(simultaneously)
Easy.
DONKEY
...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre
you always been.
SHREK
And you're still the same annoying
donkey.
DONKEY
(Bashful)
Yeah.
SHREK
Well...Look out, Princess. Here
comes the new me.
DONKEY
First things first. We need to get
you out of those clothes.
SISTER gasps.
15 EXT. THE CASTLE GATE 15
GUARD
Halt!
SHREK
Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir
Shrek, is here to see her.
FIONA wakes up as a human and looks at herself in the mirror.
She screams.
SHREK
Fiona!
FIONA
Shrek?
SHREK runs into FIONA’s room as FIONA runs down to the castle
gates. FG enters the room just before SHREK, she is cloaked.
SHREK
Fiona?
FG
Hello, handsome.
33.
FIONA
Shrek!
DONKEY
Princess!
FIONA
Donkey?
DONKEY
Wow! That potion worked on you, too?
FIONA
What potion?
DONKEY
Shrek took some magic potion. And
well...Now, he’s sexy!
FIONA
(looking at PUSS)
Shrek?
PUSS
For you, baby... I could be.
DONKEY
Yeah, you wish.
FIONA
Donkey, where is Shrek?
DONKEY
He went inside looking for you.
DONKEY and PUSS exit.
FIONA
Shrek?
SHREK
Fiona! Fiona!
FG
(blocks his exit with her
wand)
Are you going so soon? Don't you
want to see your wife?
CHARMING enters.
CHARMING
Fiona?
34.
FIONA
Shrek?
CHARMING
Aye, Fiona. It is me. What happened
to your voice?
SHREK
The potion changed a lot of things,
Fiona. But not the way I feel about
you.
KING and QUEEN enter.
QUEEN
Fiona?
KING
Charming?
CHARMING
(showing off outfit)
Do you think so?
(laughs)
Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve.
QUEEN
Um... Who are you?
KING
Mom, it's me, Shrek. I know you
never get a second chance at a first
impression, but, well, what do you
think?
(Hugs FIONA)
SHREK
Fiona! Fiona!
FG
Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho! Oh, shoot! I
don't think they can hear us,
pigeon.
(sighs deeply)
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?
SHREK
I just wanted her to be happy.
FG
And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart.
She's finally found the prince of
her dreams.
35.
SHREK
But look at me. Look what I've done
for her.
FG
It's time you stop living in a fairy
tale, Shrek. She's a princess, and
you're an ogre. That's something no
amount of potion will ever change.
SHREK
But...I love her.
FG
If you really love her... you'll let
her go.
SHREK leaves.
16 INT. THE UGLY STEPSISTER’S TAVERN 16
SISTER
Here you go, boys.
PUSS
Just leave the bottle, Doris.
SISTER
Hey. Why the long face?
SHREK
It was all just a stupid mistake. I
never should have rescued her from
that tower in the first place.
PUSS
I hate Mondays.
DONKEY
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.
SHREK
What choice do I have? She loves
that pretty boy, Prince Charming.
DONKEY
Come on. Is he really that goodlooking?
SISTER
Are you kidding? He's gorgeous! He
has a face that looks like it was
36.
carved by angels.
PUSS
Oh. He sounds dreamy.
SHREK
You know...shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better. Look,
guys. It's for the best. Mom and Dad
approve, and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of. Everybody
wins.
DONKEY
Except for you. I don't get it,
Shrek. You love Fiona.
SHREK
Aye. And that's why I have to let
her go.
KING enters in a cloak, at the back of the tavern.
KING
Excuse me, is she here?
GUARD
She's, uh... in the back.
KING
Oh, hello again. Fairy Godmother.
Charming.
FG
You'd better have a good reason for
dragging us down here, Harold.
KING
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't
really... warming up to Prince
Charming.
CHARMING
FYI, not my fault.
FG
No, of course it's not, dear.
CHARMING
I mean, how charming can I be when I
have to pretend I'm that dreadful
ogre?
KING
37.
No, no, it's nobody's fault. Perhaps
it's best if we just call the whole
thing off, okay?
FG AND CHARMING
What?
KING
You can't force someone to fall in
love!
FG
I beg to differ. I do it all the
time!
(pulls out a magical
potion from her bag)
Have Fiona drink this and she'll
fall in love with the first man she
kisses, which will be Charming.
KING
Umm... no.
FG
What did you say?
KING
I can't. I won't do it.
FG
Oh, yes, you will. If you remember,
I helped you with your happily ever
after. And I can take it away just
as easily. Is that what you want? Is
it?
KING
No.
FG
Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need
to do Charming's hair before the
ball. He's hopeless. He's all high
in the front. He can never get to
the back. You need someone to do the
back.
CHARMING
Oh. Thank you, Mother.
DONKEY
Mother?
FG
38.
The ogre! Stop them! Stop them!
The guards grab SHREK, DONKEY and PUSS and all exit.
17 INT. THE CASTLE 17
The KING enters with a pair of tea cups. He pours the poison
into one of them, just before FIONA enters.
KING
Darling? Ah. I thought I might find
you here. How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?
FIONA
I'm not going.
KING
The whole Kingdom's turned out to
celebrate your marriage.
FIONA
There's just one problem. That's not
my husband. I mean, look at him.
KING
Yes, he is a bit different, but
people change for the ones they
love. You'd be surprised how much I
changed for your mother.
FIONA
Change? He's completely lost his
mind!
KING
Why not come down to the ball and
give him another chance? You might
find you like this new Shrek.
FIONA
But it's the old one I fell in love
with, Dad. I'd give anything to have
him back.
(reached for one of the
tea cups)
KING
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.
Otherwise I'm up all night.
FIONA
39.
(drinking from the other
cup)
Thanks.
18 INT. THE DUNGEON 18
DONKEY
I got to get out of here! I got to
get out of here! You can't lock us
up like this! Let me go! What about
my Miranda rights? You're supposed
to say I have the right to remain
silent. Nobody said I have the right
to remain silent!
SHREK
You HAVE the right to remain silent.
What you lack is capacity.
PUSS
I must hold on before I, too, go
totally mad.
PINOCHIO
Shrek? Donkey?
PUSS
Too late.
SHREK
Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of
here!
GINGY
Quick! Tell a lie!
PINOCHIO
What should I say?
SHREK
Anything, but quick!
GINGY
Say something crazy like, "I'm
wearing LADIES' UNDERWEAR!"
PINOCHIO
I am wearing ladies' underwear.
SHREK
Are you?
PINOCHIO
40.
I most certainly am not!
(his nose grows)
DONKEY
It looks like you most certainly am
are!
PINOCHIO
I am not!
PUSS
What kind?
GINGY
(looking in the back of
PINOCHIO’s LEDERHOSEN)
IT'S A THONG!
PINOCHIO
Oww! They're briefs!
GINGY
Are not.
PINOCHIO
Are too!
GINGY
Here we go. Hang tight.
(picks the lock WITH
PINOCHIO’S NOSE)
SHREK
Okay boys! We've got to stop that
kiss!
DONKEY
I thought you was going to let her
go.
SHREK
I was, but I can't let them do this
to Fiona.
DONKEY
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!
PINOCHIO
It's impossible! You'll never get
in. The castle's guarded. There's a
moat and everything!
(nose shrinks back down)
41.
GINGY
Folks, it looks like we're up
chocolate creek without a Popsicle
stick.
SHREK
Don’t worry guys, I have a plan. To
the castle!
19 INT. THE ROYAL BALL 19
ROYAL MESSENGER
Ladies and gentlemen. Presenting
Princess Fiona and her new husband,
Prince Shrek.
AUDIENCE applauses, cheering. CHARMING begins waving and
encouraging the audience.
FIONA
Shrek, what are you doing?
CHARMING
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.
FIONA
Is that glitter on your lips?
CHARMING
Mm. Cherry flavored. Want to taste?
FIONA
Ugh! What is with you?
CHARMING
But, Muffin Cake...
FIONA gets fed up and turns to leave, CHARMING looks at FG
for help.
FG
(Sotto Voce)
Play something! Now!
(turns to the AUDIENCE)
Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to
dedicate this song to... Princess
Fiona and Prince Shrek.
CHARMING
Fiona, my Princess. Will you honor
me with a dance?
AUDIENCE
42.
Dance! Dance!
FIONA
Since when do you dance?
CHARMING
Fiona, my dearest, if there's one
thing I know, it's that love is full
of surprises.
OUTSIDE THE BALL
All right, fellas! Let's crash this
party!
GUARD
Halt right there!
GINGY
Make me!
GUARD grabs GINGY by the collar.
GINGY
Not the gumdrop button!
DONKEY and PUSS grab the GUARD.
DONKEY
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!
SHREK exits.
PUSS
Today, I repay my debt.
GUARD yells and is chased offstage by PUSS. DONKEY, PINOCHIO
and GINGY FOLLOW.
SHREK
Stop! Hey, you! Back away from my
wife.
FIONA
Shrek?
FG
You couldn't just go back to your
swamp and leave well enough alone.
SHREK
Pinocchio! Get the wand!
PINOCHIO runs for the wand but gets zapped along the way. His
‘PINOCHIO’ nose is gone.
43.
PINOCHIO
I'm a real boy!
The WOLF barges in and blows the wand out of FG’s hand, GINGY
picks it up and accidentally zaps PINOCHIO, his wooden nose
appears again.
PINOCHIO
I'm a real boy. Aah! Oh.
FG
That's mine!
PUSS and DONKEY enter.
DONKEY
Pray for mercy, from Puss...
PUSS
and Donkey!
FG
She's taken the potion! Kiss her
now!
CHARMING kisses FIONA.
SHREK
No!
CHARMING and FIONA look at eachother longingly, SHREK is
heartbroken.
FIONA
(headbutting CHARMING)
Hya!
ALL gasp.
SHREK
Fiona.
FIONA
Shrek.
SHREK and FIONA embrace.
FG
Harold! You were supposed to give
her the potion!
KING
Well, I guess I gave her the wrong
tea.
44.
CHARMING
(snatching the wand and
tossing it back to FG)
Mommy!
FIONA
Mommy?
FG
I told you. Ogres don't live happily
ever after.
FG tries to zap SHREK but KING grabs the wand. They both
disappear.
FIONA
Oh, Dad!
(sobbing)
PINOCHIO
Is he...?
GINGY
Yup. He croaked.
Croak sound can be heard. FIONA picks up a frog.
QUEEN
Harold?
FIONA
Dad?
KING
I'd hoped you'd never see me like
this.
DONKEY
And he gave you a hard time!
SHREK
Donkey!
KING
No, no, he's right. I'm sorry. To
both of you. I only wanted what was
best for Fiona. But I can see now...
she already has it. Shrek, Fiona...
Will you accept an old frog's
apologies... and my blessing?
QUEEN
Harold?
45.
KING
I'm sorry, Lillian. I just wish I
could be the man you deserve.
UEEN
You're more that man today than you
ever were... warts and all.
Clock chimes.
PUSS
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!
SHREK
Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you
want? To be this way forever?
FIONA
What?
SHREK
Because if you kiss me now... we can
stay like this.
FIONA
You'd do that? For me?
SHREK
Yes.
FIONA
I want what any princess wants. To
live happily ever after,
(SHREK leans in to kiss
her but she stops him)
with the ogre I married.
PUSS
Whatever happens, I must not cry!
You cannot make me cry!
(sobs)
Clock chimes. Flashing lights, as the crowd gathers round and
reveals the ogre SHREK and FIONA.
SHREK
Now, where were we? Oh. I remember.
FADE OUT:
Spotlight on DONKEY.
DONKEY
46.
Hey! Isn't we supposed to be having
a fiesta?
FANFARE
THE END.

                                               Final Screening Script
                         
                         
          INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT
                         
          A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light
          descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince
          Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open
          plains. The wind blows back his golden mane.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Onward Chauncey, to the highest
           room of the tallest tower! Where
           my princess awaits rescue from her
           handsome Prince Charming.
                         
          Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a
          wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a
          bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another
          stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.
          In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound
          effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back
          stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and
          lightning. A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front
          of a cheaply painted backdrop.
                         
          The Fairytale Creatures are sitting at a table in the
          audience.
                         
                          GINGERBREAD MAN
           This is worse than Love Letters! I
           hate dinner theatre.
                         
                          PINOCCHIO
           Me too.
                         
          Pinocchio's nose grows as he is caught in the lie.
                         
          Prince Charming rides to the base of the tower.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Whoa there, Chauncey!
                         
          He dismounts and sets his hobby horse on the ground. He
          strikes a dramatic pose.
                         
          A Princess leans from a tower window.
                         
                          ACTRESS
           Hark! The brave Prince Charming
           approach-ith.
                         
          Prince Charming puffs his chest out.

                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Fear not fair maiden! I shall slay
           the monster that guards you and
           take my place as rightful King.
                         
          An old couple at a table look confused.
                         
                          OLD LADY
           (to old man)
           What did she say?
                         
          Prince Charming glares as the bored audience largely ignores
          him.
                         
          A man in a bad ogre costume comes onto the stage.
                         
                          OGRE
           Grrrrrrr!
                         
          The crowd erupts into applause. The Fairytale Creatures
          cheer.
                         
                          FAIRYTALE CREATURES

                          GINGERBREAD MAN
           Yea! Shrek!
                         
          At first, Prince Charming is put off by the cheers for the
          Shrek-like beast. He pulls his sword and confronts the
          monster.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Prepare foul beast to enter into a
           world of pain with which you are
           not familiar!
                         
          He is cut off as a waiter enters with a birthday cake.
                         
                          WAITER
                          (SINGING)
           Happy Birthday to thee.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Do you mind?
                         
          Prince Charming hops out of the way when a chair lands on
          stage. It slides past him and bumps into the tower facade.
                         
                          GINGERBREAD MAN
           Do you mind? Bo-ring!

          The audience laughs. Prince Charming glares at them and then
          tries to recover. He points his sword at the monster again.
          The tower facade starts to topple.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (CLEARS THROAT)
           Prepare foul beast-
                         
          Prince Charming looks over his shoulder and sees the facade
          falling. He cringes.
                         
          The scenery slams against the stage, but Prince Charming is
          unharmed, perfectly framed in the princesses' window. The
          crowd laughs at the embarrassed Prince Charming. He shakes
          his mangled sword at the audience.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           (shaking his sword again)
           Someday you'll be sorry.
                         
                          HECKLER
           (O.S.)
           We already are!
                         
          They laugh again. Prince Charming throws down his sword,
          picks up his hobby horse and exits.
                         
                          OGRE
           Grrrrrrr!
                         
          The song and the laughter follow Prince Charming backstage.
                         
                         
          INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Prince Charming walks through a tunnel backstage that leads
          to a door. The door has a star with his name written on it.
          He opens it.
                         
                         
          EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Prince Charming sits at his broken vanity and sobs. His make-
          shift dressing room is in an alley way next to the theater.
                         
          Horses whinny as a carriage passes by. The castle of Far Far
          Away can be seen on the hill in the background. Prince
          Charming breaks down and cries.
                         
          He looks up and sees a picture of the Fairy Godmother taped
          to the vanity. "Don't stop believing! Mommy's Little Angel"
          is written on the picture.

                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (HEAVY SOBS)
           Oh mommy.
                         
          He weeps again and then looks back at the picture. A
          determined change grows across his face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh, you're right. I can't let this
           happen. I can't.
                         
          Prince Charming looks at the castle on the hill. His
          expression hardens. He stands and faces the castle. He
          holds his chin up high.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           I am the rightful King of Far Far
           Away and I promise you this mother.
           I will restore dignity to my
           throne!
                         
          A big gust of wind blows a newspaper page across his face.
          He peels it off and looks at the headline. His eyes tense
          and narrow.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           And this time, no one will stand in
           my way!
                         
          In the newspaper is a picture of Shrek and Fiona waving to a
          crowd.
                         
          Prince Charming crumples up the newspaper in his fists.
                         
                         
          EXT. CASTLE - MORNING
                         
          The camera booms down from the Far Far Away sign. The sun
          rises and the birds sing.
                         
                         
          INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The sun shines through the bedroom window as the camera pans
          over to Shrek and Fiona waking up.
                         
                          SHREK
           Good morning.

          Shrek breathes in and smiles.

                          (DREAMY)
           I know. Isn't it wonderful?
                         
          The bedroom doors fly open and Donkey and the Dronkeys rush
          in. The Dronkeys head right for Shrek and Fiona. Shrek
          cowers beneath the bedclothes.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (SINGING)
           "Good morning! Good morning!"
                         
          Shrek sinks further into the blankets as the Dronkeys
          exuberantly lick him. Fiona is amused.
                         
          Donkey starts to sing "Good Morning" from Singin' in the Rain
          as he enters the room.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (SINGING)
           "The sun is shining through! Good
           morning! Good morning.
           (coming closer and closer
                          TO SHREK)
           "To you!"
                          (TO SHREK)
           "And you!"
                          (TO DRONKEY)
           And you!
                         
          The Dronkeys fly out of the room, knocking down everything in
          their path.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Oh, they grow up so fast.
                         
          Shrek, greatly annoyed, lifts his hand and snuffs out a
          little fire on the bed left behind by the Dronkeys.
                         
                          SHREK
           Not fast enough.
                         
          Puss leaps onto the bed.
                         
                          PUSS
           Okay. You have a very full day
           filling in for the King and Queen.
           There are several functions that
           require your attendance, sir.

                          SHREK
           Great! Let's get started.
                         
          Shrek immediately pulls the covers up over his head and
          starts to snore.
                         
                          DONKEY
           C'mon, lazy bones, time to get
           movin'!
                         
          Donkey yanks the sheets off of Fiona and Shrek. He is
          surprised to see Shrek's bare legs.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aaahhh! You know you really need
           to get yourself a pair of jammies.
                         
          Shrek sighs.

          INT. KNIGHTING CEREMONY - DAY
                         
          The camera pans down from a stained glass window. The song
          "Royal Pain" by the Eels plays in the background as the
          title: "Shrek The Third" is superimposed.
                         
          A large crowd has gathered to watch the knighting. Shrek
          walks down the aisle of the church.
                         
          Shrek walks up to the knight who seems a bit nervous.
                         
          Shrek takes a sword from Puss, but he doesn't have any idea
          what he is supposed to do with it. Shrek looks at Puss, who
          indicates how to knight a person with his own sword. Shrek
          starts to knight the knight.
                         
                          SHREK
           I knight thee...
                         
          Shrek accidentally stabs the knight.
                         
                          SHREK
           He-he. Ooh.
                         
          The crowd, Fiona, Puss and Donkey look on, shocked.

          Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal
          Navy.
                         
          Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the
          boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws
          the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the
          side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks.
                         
          Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their
          heads as they leave.

          INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around
          Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of
          them.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Well, since you're filling in for
           one, you might as well look like a
           real King. Can somebody come in
           here and work on Shrek please?
                         
          Raul stares at Shrek. Shrek raises his eyebrow.
                         
                          RAUL
                          (AHEM)
           I will see what I can do.
                         
          He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair.
                         
          A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip
          cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He
          turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind
          away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.
                         
          We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into
          frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash.
                         
          Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.

          Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to
          reveal that the lips are Shrek's.
                         
          A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps
          snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and
          tighten up the zipper all the way.
                         
          A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn,
          Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP!
                         
          A collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is
          tightened.
                         
          A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's
          belt. A mole is placed on his cheek.

          Donkey gasps.

                          PUSS
           Yeah, wow.
                         
          Fiona is uncomfortable.

          Fiona turns to Shrek and sees he is not in a good mood.
                         
                          SHREK
           I don't know how much longer I can
           keep this up Fiona.
                         
                          FIONA
           I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please
           just try to grin and bear it? It's
           just until Dad gets better.
                         
          Shrek lets out another frustrated sigh.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek?
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah.
                         
                          FIONA
           You look handsome.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah. Come here, you.
                         
          She gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles
          back.
                         
          Fiona puckers up her lips and Shrek leans in for a kiss, but
          their bulky outfits prevent it.
                         
          Shrek and Fiona let out a huge breath of air.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, my butt is itching up a storm
           and I can't reach it in this monkey
           suit!
                         
          Shrek tries to scratch his butt but to no avail.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh.

           Hey you. Come here!
                         
          A man holding a ruby scepter walks over to Shrek.

          The audience claps. The curtain starts to open.
          Fiddlesworth is scratching away at Shrek's butt.
                         
                          SHREK
           You've done it. Oh, a little over
           to the left, yeah. That's great.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh Shrek?
                         
          Fiddlesworth struggles to reach Shrek's itch. The crowd
          looks on in horror. Fiona tries to get his attention.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh
           yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it!
           Oh that's good!
                         
                          FIONA

                          SHREK
           Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You
           got it. You're on it. That's
           great!
                         
                          FIONA
           SHREK!
                         
          Shrek and Fiddlesworth finally see the crowd. They both
          freeze. Shrek laughs nervously.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's belt buckle snaps off and hits Donkey in the
          eye. He stumbles through the crowd screaming.
                         
                          DONKEY

          As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.
                         
                          WOMAN
           What are you doing?
                         
          The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a
          guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the
          axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The
          axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona
          maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the
          vase which causes Fiona to fall over.
                         
          Shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding
          Shrek's pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his
          pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona!
                         
          He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the
          stage. The plank flings up and sends Fiddlesworth flying
          through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole,
          trapping him.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Uhhh...
                          (WIMPER)
                         
          Shrek has reached Fiona who is still lying on the floor.
                         
                          SHREK
           Are you okay?
                         
                          FIONA
           Yeah. I'm fine.
                         
          Fiona's eyes suddenly widen.
                         
          Fiddlesworth's jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter
          carrying flaming skewers.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Ahhhh!
                         
          The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame
          with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and
          land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of
          the skewers out and takes a bite.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Oh! Shrimp! My favorite.

          The fire causes a Far Far Away shield to detach from a wooden
          ceiling beam and fall onto the stage, breaking it in half.
                         
          The whole stage collapses in the middle. The buffet tables
          slide toward Shrek and Fiona at the other end and collide.
                         
          CRASH! BANG!

          The door to Fiona's room flies open.
                         
                          SHREK
           That's it! We're leaving!
                         
          Shrek storms in pulling bits of buffet food off his face.
                         
                          FIONA
           Honey, please calm down...
                         
          Shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside.
                         
                          SHREK
           Calm down? Who do you think we're
           kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut
           out for this, Fiona and I never
           will be.
                         
          Shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings
          his shirt to the floor. He falls onto the bed next to
          Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I think that went pretty well.
                         
          Shrek startles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey!
                         
          Shrek picks him up and throws him out the door.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aww, come on now Shrek!
                         
          Shrek slams the door shut.
                         
          Shrek turns back towards the bed and sees Puss reclining on
          his pillow.

           Some people just don't understand
           boundaries.
                         
          Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him
          outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the
          ledge, giving Shrek his sad-eyes routine. Shrek draws the
          blinds.
                         
          Shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. Fiona tries
          to calm him down.
                         
                          FIONA
           Just think... a couple more days,
           and we'll be back home in our
           vermin-filled shack, strewn with
           fungus, filled with the rotting
           stench of mud and neglect.
                         
          This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath
          and exhales. He smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."
                         
                          FIONA
           And, uh... maybe even the pitter-
           patter of little feet on the
           floor...?
                         
                          SHREK
                          (LAUGHS)
           That's right. The swamp rats will
           be spawning.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh, no... you know, what I was
           thinking of is a little bit bigger
           than a swamp rat.

                          FIONA
           No, Shrek. Um... what if -

           They were little ogre feet?

          Shocked, Shrek falls off the bed.
                         
          He slowly emerges from behind the bed.
                         
                          SHREK
           Honey? Let's try and be rational
           about this. Have you seen a baby
           lately? They just eat and poop and
           they cry and then they cry when
           they poop and they poop when they
           cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby.
           They extra cry and they extra poop.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek.
                         
          She grabs his hands and looks deeply into his eyes.
                         
                          FIONA
           Don't you ever think about having a
           family?
                         
          Shrek takes her hand.
                         
                          SHREK
           Right now, you're my family.
                         
          There is a knock on the bedroom door. The door bursts open,
          revealing a Royal Page.
                         
          Shrek springs up.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well, somebody better be dying.

          The camera pushes through a corridor that leads to the King's
          bedroom. The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           I'm dying.
                         
          The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit.
          Shrek looks a bit guilty about his last admission. The Queen
          comes to the King's aid and he settles down.

          The Queen is used to these kind of non-sequiturs.

          The King suppresses a few coughs. He turns to his daughter.
                         
                          KING HAROLD

                          KING HAROLD
           I know I've made many mistakes with
           you.
                         
                          FIONA
           It's okay.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           But your love for Shrek has taught
           me so much.
                         
          Fiona smiles. The King addresses Shrek.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           My dear boy, I am proud to call you
           my son.

           Frog... King Dad in-law.
                         
          Shrek smiles.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           Now, there is a matter of business
           to attend tooo...
                         
          The King starts wheezing and coughing. Eventually he stops.
          They think he's dead. Puss solemnly removes his hat.
                         
                          PUSS
           The Frog King is dead.

                          (TO PUSS)
           Put your hat back on, fool.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           Shrek, please come hither.
                         
          Fiona gives Shrek a look. Shrek walks over to the King.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah, Dad?
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           This Kingdom needs a new king. You
           and Fiona are next in line for the
           throne.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ooo. Next in line. Now you see
           Dad, that's why people love you.
           Even on your deathbed you're still
           making jokes.
                         
          The King stares at Shrek, stone-faced. Shrek leans in
          closer.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King?
           I don't think that's such a good
           idea. There's got to be somebody
           else. Anybody?
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           Aside from you there is only one
           remaining heir.
                         
          Shrek brightens.
                         
                          SHREK

          Shrek leans in closer after each "is," waiting in
          anticipation. The King starts to hyperventilate.
                         
                          FIONA
           Daddy!
                         
          The King is dead. A fly comes out of his mouth and flies
          away.
                         
          Puss starts to take his hat off. The fly buzzes into frame.
          A tongue catches it. Puss puts his hat back on.
                         
                          KING HAROLD

          Puss takes his hat off.
                         
          Fiona starts to cry and hugs Shrek. The weight of the King's
          request hits Shrek. He is in a state of shock.
                         
          We hold a moment on the Queen, Shrek, Fiona, Puss and Donkey
          to let the King's passing sink in.

          The knights of Far Far Away march toward the castle as the
          flag is lowered to half-masked.
                         
                         
          EXT. POND - LATER
                         
          Close on a statue of the late King. Shrek, Fiona, the Queen,
          and all the Fairy-tale Creatures and Princesses have gathered
          for the funeral. The Queen sets an old shoe box ("Ye Olde
          Footlocker") on top of a lily pad and sends it floating out
          into the water.
                         
          An overhead shot shows the box floating through the lily
          pads. The camera tilts up to reveal a frog choir, singing
          "Live and Let Die." The Princesses, Donkey, Puss and the
          Fairy-tale Creatures all bow their heads solemnly.
                         
          Shrek puts his arm around Fiona.
                         
          The funeral has ended and the crowd begins to disperse.
          Shrek, Fiona and the Queen stand by the pond. The Queen
          sadly gazes at the pond.

          The camera pulls back to reveal a cloaked figure, on
          horseback, overlooking the funeral. The figure removes his
          hood to reveal Prince Charming. He gives a smug smile, and
          rides off.

          INT. POISONED APPLE BAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Smoke wafts through the screen. The camera pans down to the
          top of a piano where an ashtray with a lit cigarette burns
          and a brandy sifter is filled with coins. The camera pans
          over to a Singing Witch who turns around to reveal a
          microphone in her hand. The Singing Witch starts to sing
          "I've Never Been To Me" by Nancy Wilson.
                         
          The bar is filled with various Fairy-tale Villains. Two
          pirates sit forlornly with their mugs. The Puppet Master
          takes a drink out of a beer mug. He is surrounded by a bunch
          of empty beer mugs.
                         
          Prince Charming enters the bar.
                         
          A group is gathered around Cyclops riding a medieval
          mechanical bull, hooting and hollering. The bull stops and
          the Villains turn to look at Prince Charming.
                         
          Prince Charming hangs his cape on a tree branch. The camera
          adjusts right to reveal the branch is actually one of the
          Evil Trees, who flings the cape to the floor. Everyone takes
          notice as Prince Charming walks through. Little Red Riding
          Hood is sitting on a pile of books at a table. Evil Dwarves
          glare in Prince Charming's direction. Prince Charming walks
          by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White)
          playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and
          the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman's neck.
          Prince Charming walks by the singing witch. He reaches the
          bar, pulls out a handkerchief, places it over the bar stool,
          and sits.
                         
          Prince Charming spots the bartender with her back to him. He
          clears his throat.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           What does a Prince have to do to
           get a drink around here?
                         
          Mabel, the other ugly stepsister, rises up in front a poster
          with a smiling beer wench.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly
           stepsister I'll never know.
                         
          He winks at her. She glares at him.

           are you.
                         
          She spits into the mug and wipes it with a towel.
                         
                          MABEL (CONT'D)

           And a Fuzzy Navel.
                         
          Prince Charming stands up and turns to the bar patrons.

          Captain Hook rips his hook across the piano keys. The
          singing witch bares her teeth. The witches break their pool
          cues. The Puppet Master breaks his beer mug.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           We're not your friends.
                         
          Prince Charming grows nervous.
                         
          The Villains all approach Prince Charming.
                         
          From behind the bar, Mabel grabs Prince Charming by his
          shoulders and pins him on top of the bar.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ahh!
                         
          Captain Hook places his hook against Prince Charming's neck.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           You don't belong here.

           ... Need I say more?
                         
          Captain Hook backs off, feeling insecure about his appendage.

           are two sides to every story. And
           our side has not been told.
                         
          The crowd listens, rapt.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           So who will join me? Who wants to

           wants their happily ever after?!
                         
          The crowd of villains cheer and starts getting rowdy. A bar
          room brawl ensues. Prince Charming looks on, shocked. He
          ducks out of the way of a flying liquor bottle. He smiles
          nervously and lifts his fruity, Fuzzy Navel to drink.

                          PUSS
           It's out of my hands senorita, the
           winds of fate have blown on my
           destiny. But I will never forget
           you. You are the love of my life.
                         
          Off-screen, a cat meows and walks towards Puss.

           And you.
                         
          Puss starts walking away as two of the cats begin to engage
          in a cat fight. They are hissing at each other as Puss backs
          away from them and into another.

           but I'd like to. I gotta go.
                         
          Puss runs out of frame. Cut to Dragon, who is talking to
          Donkey. Puss runs past them in the background. Dragon lets
          out a soft wail.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I know, I know... I don't want to
           leave you either baby, but you know
           how Shrek is. The dude's lost
           without me.
                         
          She gives him an understanding smile.

          He blows her a kiss and she catches it. He looks down at his
          children, holding back tears.

          The Dronkey that Fiona is holding flies off to join Donkey

           and be King.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could
           ever run a kingdom. That's why your
           cousin Arthur's the perfect choice.
                         
                          FIONA
           It's not that. No. It's, you
           see...
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           And if he gives me any trouble,
           I've always got persuasion and
           reason.
           (holds up his right fist)
           Here's persuasion,
           (holds up his left fist)
           and here's reason.
                         
          Shrek chuckles. Fiona gives him a look. Shrek reassures her.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona, soon it's just gonna be you
           and me and our swamp.
                         
                          FIONA
                          (HESITANT)
           It's not going to be just you and
           me.
                         
          The ship's fog horn sounds.
                         
                          SHIP CAPTAIN

                          SHREK
           It will be. I promise. I love
           you.
                         
          He kisses her and joins Puss and Donkey on the boat.
                         
          He title proudly reads: H.R.M CRUSHING RESPONSIBILITY II
                         
          The boat sets sail. The Dronkeys spell out "We Love You
          Daddy" with smoke in the sky.

           That's lovely.
                         
          Donkey waves to his kids, sobs.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Bye bye babies!
                         
          Fiona runs after the boat.

           Shrek!
                         
          Shrek leans against the rail, calling out to her.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah?
                         
                          FIONA

                          SHREK
           What is it?
                         
          She smiles and takes a deep breath.
                         
                          FIONA
           I'm, I'm-
                         
          The Ship Captain blows a fog horn and cuts her off. Shrek
          smiles back at her.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (LAUGHS)

          The Ship Captain starts to blow again. Shrek grabs the horn
          and throws it overboard.
                         
                          SHREK
           You're what?!
                         
                          FIONA
           I said I'm pregnant!
                         
          The Fairy-tale Creatures behind Fiona cheer.

           Uh... what was that?
                         
                          FIONA
           You're going to be a father!

                          (NERVOUS LAUGH)
           That's great.
                         
                          FIONA
           Really? I'm glad you think so! I
           love you.
                         
          Shrek smiles back at Fiona.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah...

           Me too... you...
                         
          Fiona smiles as the Queen places a hand on her shoulder.
                         
          Overjoyed at the news, Donkey pops up onto the railing.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Oh, and you my friend are royally--
                         
          The fog horn blasts again as the boat disappears into the
          fog.

          EXT. BOAT CABIN - NIGHT
                         
          The boat travels along in the open sea. Shrek is fast asleep
          as the boat travels through an estuary and beaches itself.
                         
          Shrek wakes up. He opens the cabin door.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahhh. Home.
                         
          He smiles to himself. The boat has beached itself right
          outside of Shrek's swamp house.
                         
          He leaps off the boat.
                         
                          SHREK
           Woohoo!
                         
                         
          EXT. SWAMP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Shrek takes a deep breath of swamp air.

           Ahh.
                         
          He skips and dances happily toward his house.

          He sashays through the front door with his eyes closed,
          presenting himself.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona!
                         
          After a moment of silence, he opens his eyes, realizing that
          Fiona is not there.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona?
                         
          He looks around the room, puzzled. The door slams closed
          behind him.

          A baby carriage rolls slowly into frame behind him. He turns
          slowly and sees the baby carriage covered with a blanket.
          Shrek removes the blanket, revealing a baby ogre, smiling
          innocently at him.
                         
                          SHREK
           Huh? Oh no.
                         
          The baby burps.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (AMUSED)
           Better out than in, I always say.
           Ha ha!
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Hiccup!
                         
          This time the baby's burp turns into projectile vomit aimed
          directly at Shrek. Shrek puts his hand up to block the
          vomit, but to no avail. The baby continues to vomit, but
          eventually stops after completely soiling himself and Shrek.
          The baby looks like it's about to cry. Shrek raises his
          hands.
                         
                          SHREK
           No, no, no, no, no, no. Ha, ha.
           It's okay. It's gonna be alright.
                         
          Shrek picks the baby up, smiling at it cautiously. He holds
          it awkwardly for a few seconds, then looks up and realizes
          that his house is filled with babies.
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Da-Da!
                         
          Babies roll around his living room, tearing the fabric off
          his chair. The chair reclines, catapulting one of the babies
          onto Shrek's head. A standing lamp with a baby on top falls,
          and Shrek dives to catch him. Another baby is pulling the
          tablecloth, causing lethal knives to fly straight at him.
          Shrek snatches the baby away just before he is impaled. One
          of the babies strikes a match near the fireplace. Shrek runs
          over, picks up the baby and blows out the match. He takes a
          baby out of the cauldron.
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya?
           No, no. Stop! Hey, hey, hey. No.
                         
          Shrek panics. A baby is knocking glass jars off the shelf.
          Shrek catches him before he crawls off of it. Shrek runs
          through the room picking up babies.

          After he has collected as many babies as he can, Shrek slides
          open the curtain to his bedroom.
                         
                          SHREK
           Huh?
                         
          He sees a baby sitting in his bed, smiling up at him. The
          baby shrugs.
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Bubabatoo?
                         
          Suddenly, Shrek hears a loud rumble. He turns around.
          Babies start pouring out of the window and the fireplace.
          First there is one, then two, then thirty more follow.
          Hundreds of them start piling in.
                         
          Shrek makes a run for the doorway, but no matter how hard he
          runs, the doorway keeps getting farther and farther away! He
          keeps trying, hundreds of babies trailing behind.

          Finally, Shrek reaches the door and opens it. He slams it
          shut behind him and closes his eyes. Everything is quiet.
          He opens his eyes and finds himself on stage in front of his
          high school.
                         
          Shrek looks up to find a graduation cap on his head. The
          audience is full of ogre babies laughing at him. The camera
          pulls back to reveal Shrek standing at the podium, naked.

          Shrek's eyes pop open, he sits upright and tries to compose
          himself.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahhhh! Oh, Donkey! Donkey, wake-
           up!
                         
          Donkey and Puss turn around, but they both have baby-ogre
          faces! Donkey makes a baby noise. As the camera zooms in,
          Donkey's eyes glow red and his teeth become sharp and pointy.

          Puss wake up.

          He breaths heavily, trying to compose himself.

           Oh... I can't believe I'm going to
           be a father.
                         
          Donkey and Puss look at each other. He gets up and walks to
          the ship's railing.

           Allow me to explain. You see, when
           a man has certain feelings for a

           can't believe it.
                         
          Shrek walks away.
                         
          Donkey leans over to Puss.

          Shrek cuts Donkey off.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey, can you just cut to the
           part where you're supposed to make
           me feel better?
                         
          Shrek slumps against the rail. Puss hops up on the railing
          and whispers into Shrek's other ear.
                         
                          PUSS
           You know I love Fiona, Boss.
           Right?

           you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice-
           cold pitcher of mojitos, and two
           weeks of nothing but fishing.
                         
          Puss makes a "let's go fishing" gesture by casting an
          imaginary rod into the ocean. Donkey is right there to
          whisper in Shrek's other ear.

           ruining. It's the kid's.
                         
          Donkey and Puss pause as Shrek rants.

           Now gentlemen let's away... to the
           showers!

           Oy! Right! Ooo! Ooo!
                         
          Shrek approaches the Knight.
                         
          The Knight's horse rears up and he falls off. The horse
          gallops off. The Knight looks up at Shrek in fear.

                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           Greetings your majesty. This is
           your lucky day.
                         
                          KNIGHT (LANCELOT)
           So what for like are you supposed
           to be? Some kind of giant mutant
           leprechaun or something?
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, ho, ho, ho. Giant mutant
           leprechaun... You made a funny.
                         
          Shrek scoops up the Knight, tosses him over his shoulder,
          ogre-style.
                         
                          KNIGHT (LANCELOT)
           Unhand me, monster!
                         
                          SHREK
           Stop squirming, Arthur.
                         
                          KNIGHT (LANCELOT)
           I'm not Arthur!
                         
          Shrek stops and holds Lancelot above his head. Lancelot
          tries to regain his dignity.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           I am Lancelot.
                         
          Lancelot points across the school yard.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           That dork over there is Arthur!
                         
          He points to the TEENAGE ARTHUR, skulking away across the
          school yard.
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey!
                         
          Artie turns his head briefly, but keeps on walking.
                         
          Shrek sighs and dumps Lancelot to the ground.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           Aaah.
                         
          Shrek storms off towards the school. Puss and Donkey catch
          up. One of the female students steps in front of Shrek.

           embarrassing, but my friend Tiffany
           thinkest thou vex her so soothly...
                         
          The other girls giggle.
                         
                          GUINEVERRE

           It's like whatever. She's just
           totally into college guys and

          Shrek and Puss search the hallways, looking for Artie.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh Arthur! Come out, come out
           wherever you are...
                         
          Off-screen we hear mumbling from inside a locker. Shrek and
          Puss look as Donkey pushes the locker door open. He has been
          stuffed inside. Off-screen we hear some students laughing.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Yeah, you better run, you little
           punk no good-niks, `cause the days
           of "Little Donkey Dumpy Drawers"
           are over!
                         
          An "I Suck-eth" sign has been taped Donkey's butt.
                         
          Shrek spots students entering the Gymnasium. They approach a
          HALL MONITOR who stops them.

          Two mascot costumed students walk up to the hall monitor.

                          COSTUME STUDENT 2
           Grrrrr!
                         
          The Hall Monitor waves them in. Shrek gets an idea.
                         
                          SHREK
           (pleased with himself)
           We're here for the Mascot Contest
           too.
                         
          The Hall Monitor reaches out and starts painfully pinching
          and pulling Shrek's skin. Shrek tries to hide the pain.
                         
                          HALL MONITOR
                          (SUSPICIOUS)

           long!
                         
          The Hall Monitor lets his face snap back into place. Shrek
          struggles not to scream in agony. Hall Monitor is still
          suspicious.
                         
                          HALL MONITOR
           Looks pretty real to me.
                         
                          PUSS
           If it were real could I do this?
                         
          Puss's claws snap out one at a time like jack-knives and then
          Puss jabs all the claws deep into Shrek's butt.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Or this?
                         
          Donkey kicks Shrek hard in the groin with his hind legs.
          Shrek winces and sweats.

          Principal Pynchley presides over an assembly for the entire

                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           Thank you to Professor Primbottom
           for his invigorating lecture on how
           to just say "nay".
                         
          Two students are standing next to Pynchley. One is dressed
          up like a dragon and the other as a griffin.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY

          Shrek bursts through the double-doors of the gym.
                         
           PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY (CONT'D)
           --ogre?
                         
          The students gasp as Shrek marches forward.
                         
                          SHREK
           That's right. I'm the new mascot.
           So let's really try and beat the
           other guys... at whatever it is
           they're doing.
                         
          The band plays Smashmouth's "Rock Star."
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           This is indeed all a bit
           unorthodox.
                         
          Without breaking stride, Shrek grabs Principal Pynchley's
          megaphone.
                         
                          SHREK

          The students all point... to the basketball hoop, where Artie
          hangs helplessly. Shrek, Donkey and Puss turn and look up
          and see the freshly wedgied student. The students laugh.
                         
          In the front row, Lancelot bumps fists with Bohort.
                         
                          LANCELOT

                          LANCELOT
           I didn't do it. They did.
                         
          Lance points to the D&D nerds. They are beside themselves
          with nasal laughter. Nosebleed boy starts bleeding again.
                         
          Shrek reaches up and pulls Artie down to eye level.
                         
                          ARTIE

          Even Principal Pynchley gets caught up in the excitement.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           Eat him!
          Shrek yanks on Artie and pulls him off the hoop.
                         
                          SHREK
           I'm not here to eat him.

           Absolutely. Now clean out your
           locker, kid. You've got a kingdom
           to run.

                          SHREK
           The one and only.

           Give me just a second.
                         
          Artie turns back to the crowd and delivers a heartfelt
          speech.
                         
                          ARTIE
           My good people, I think there's a
           lesson here for all of us. Maybe
           the next time you're about to dunk
           a kid's head in a chamber pot,
           you'll stop and think, hey, maybe
           this guy has feelings. Maybe I
           should cut him some slack. Because
           maybe, just maybe... this guy's
           gonna turn out to be, uh...I
           dunno...a King! And maybe his
           first royal decree will be to
           banish everyone who ever picked on
           him -- that's right, I'm looking at

                          ARTIE
           Really? Wow! Look, I know it's not
           all gonna be fun and games.
                         
                          SHREK
           It really is all fun and games,
           actually. Sure, you have to knight
           a few heroes, launch a ship or two.
           By the way, make sure you hit the
           boat just right with the bottle.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Boat with the bottle? Any idiot
           can hit a boat with a bottle.
                         
          Shrek chuckles sheepishly.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well, I've heard it's harder than
           it looks.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Whoa!! This is gonna be huge.
           Parties, princesses, castles...
           princesses.
                         
                          DONKEY
           It's gonna be great, Artie. You'll
           be living in the lap of luxury.
           They got the finest chefs around
           waiting for you to place your
           order.
                         
          Puss jumps up onto the railing next to Artie.
                         
                          PUSS

                          PUSS
           They taste the food before the King
           eats, to make sure it's not
           poisoned.

          Shrek senses trouble and immediately steps in.

           Or too salty!
                         
          Shrek turns to Puss and Donkey, trying to shut them up.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (TO ARTIE)
           Don't worry about it. You'll be

           your body guards.

                          PUSS
           All of them, willing at a moment's
           notice to lay down their own lives
           out of devotion to you.

           Si, and the whole kingdom will look
           to you for wisdom and guidance.
                         
          Behind Artie, Shrek mouths "shut-up" to Puss and Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY

           The coughing, the groaning, the
           festering sores.
                         
          Shrek interrupts with a mock laugh.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh! Festering sores! Hey, you are
           one funny kitty cat.
                         
                          PUSS
           What did I say?
                         
                          SHREK
           We don't want Artie here getting
           the wrong idea.
                         
          Shrek motions to Artie, but he's gone. They all look around.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           Uh, Artie?
                         
          The boat suddenly pitches to the right. Shrek braces
          himself. Puss and Donkey tumble away.
                         
                          ALL
           Whoa!
                         
          Artie swings the wheel around, sending the boat back in the
          direction of his school. Shrek works his way into the cabin
          and gains control of the wheel. The drunken Ship Captain
          slides by.
                         
                          SHIP CAPTAIN
           Whoa! Oh, there goes my hip.
                         
                          SHREK
           Artie!
                         
          Shrek turns the wheel the other way.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?!
                         
          The boat veers again, heading back toward Far Far Away.
          Artie falls to the ground and slides to the back of the boat.
                         
          A shuffle board stick slides next to Artie. He grabs it.
                         
                          ARTIE
           What does it look like?!
                         
          He jams it in the boat's wheel. The boat lurches.

          He swings the boat back in the other direction. Shrek rises
          up and grabs the wheel and turns it.
                         
                          SHREK
           This really isn't up to you!
                         
          Artie falls underneath the wheel. He stands up shoving the
          wheel back the other way.
                         
                          ARTIE
           But I don't know anything about
           being King!
                         
                          SHREK
           You'll learn on the job!
                         
          Donkey and Puss roll across the deck.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Whoaaa!
                         
          Shrek grabs the wheel and swings it around. Artie yanks the
          wheel. They wrestle for control.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm
           going back!
                         
                          SHREK
           Back to what? Being a loser?!
                         
          As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone
          too far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to
          yank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from the
          decking.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)

           Look what I did? Who's holding the
           wheel chief?
                         
          Donkey climbs up onto the railing. He is seasick and is
          about to puke when he sees jagged rocks ahead.

           Shrek!
                         
          Shrek desperately sets the wheel back down and tries to steer
          the ship clear of the rocks.

          The camera pans past the boat. Off-screen we hear the boat
          crash into the rocks.

          Shrek, holding Puss and Donkey, staggers onto a small beach.
          He glares at Artie who pulls himself out of the surf. Shrek
          drops Puss and Donkey.
                         
          Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously. His fur
          puffs up into a fro. He drops his head in shame.
                         
                          PUSS
           How humiliating...

           What happened to "loser?" Huh?
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey, if you think this is getting
           you out of anything, well it isn't.
           We're heading back to Far Far Away
           one way or another, and you're
           gonna be a father!
                         
          Artie raises an eyebrow. Puss and Donkey stare at Shrek
          uncomfortably.

          Artie shakes his head and marches down the beach toward a
          path into the woods.
                         
                          SHREK

                          PUSS
           Uh boss, I don't think he's coming
           back and maybe it's for the best.
           He is not exactly king material.
                         
          Shrek looks towards Artie.

           Oh c'mon, now why would I do that?
           Besides, he'll be ten times better
           at it than me.
                         
          Shrek starts off after Artie. Donkey jumps in front of Shrek.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then
           you're gonna have to change your
           tactics if you want to get anywhere
           with this kid.

           You're right, Donkey.
                         
          Shrek picks up a piece of driftwood.
                         
                          SHREK

                          SHREK
           Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.

          Shrek walks off, trying to catch up to Artie.

          Shrek thinks for a moment and then tries a different tactic
          with the kid. He catches up to Artie.
                         
                          SHREK

          Artie looks back over his shoulder. He sees Shrek and just
          keeps going.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           If you think this whole mad scene
           ain't dope, I feel you dude. I
           mean, I'm not trying to get up in
           your grill or raise your roof or
           whatever, but what I am screaming
           is, yo, check out this kazing
           thazing bazaby.
                         
          Puss and Donkey glance at each other. Artie notices a
          cottage in the distance and heads toward it.
                         
                          SHREK
           I mean, if it doesn't groove or
           what I'm saying ain't straight
           trippin', just say, oh no you
           didn't, you know, you're gettin' on
           my last nerve. And then I'll know
           it's... then I'll know it's whack--
                         
          Passing a tree, Artie nonchalantly releases the branch,
          striking Shrek square in the face and takes off running.

          EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP -- CONTINUOUS
                         
          A boiling soup pot sits over a fire in front of a small
          shack. Artie charges though, pounding desperately on the
          door.
                         
                          ARTIE
           SOMEBODY HELP! I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED
           BY A MONSTER TRYING TO RELATE TO
           ME!
                         
                          SHREK
           Artie! Wait!
                         
                         
          Shrek, Puss, and Donkey run into the camp.
                         
                          ARTIE
           C'mon! C'mon! Help! Help!
           Hello?
                         
          Suddenly, a burst of light shoots through a candle box that
          is hung on the door. A bright, colorful image of an old
          wizard's head is projected out. Donkey is terrified.
                         
                          DONKEY
           AHHHH!
                         
           WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN)
           Greetings cosmic children of the
           universe, and welcome to my
           serenity circle!
                         
          Shrek watches.
                         
           WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN)
           Please leave any bad vibes outside
           the healing vortex. And now
           prepare ...
                         
          With a "FZZZZT" and a "BLOOP", the image disappears.
                         
          The door opens and a tiny old man, Merlin, comes out.
                         
                          MERLIN
           I knew I should of gotten that
           warranty!
                         
          Merlin smashes the security device with his little fist and
          is promptly zapped in the head.

           Mr. Merlin?
                         
                          SHREK
           You know this guy?
                         
                          ARTIE
           Yeah. He was the school's magic
           teacher until he had his nervous
           breakdown.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, technically I was merely a
           victim of a level three fatigue,
           and at the request of my therapist
           and the school authorities, I have
           retired to the tranquility of
           nature to discover my divine
           purpose.
                         
          Merlin smacks a fly that has landed on his head.
                         
          Shrek and Artie stare in astonishment.
                         
                         
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now, can I interest anyone in a
           snack or beverage?
                         
                          SHREK
           Uh, no.
                         
          Merlin offers up a baking dish full of rocks.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Sure you don't wanna try my famous
           rock au-gratin?
                         
          Merlin takes a bite and chews loudly. His gums are bleeding
          from eating rocks.
                         
                          MERLIN
           It's organic!
                         
          They both stare at him uncomfortably.

           Oh, thanks, I just ate a boulder on

           directions back to Far Far Away.

           was going with you?
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of
           people counting on you so don't try
           and weasel out of it.

           If it's such a great job, why don't
           you do it?
                         
                          SHREK
           Understand this kid, it's no more
           Mr. Nice Guy from here on out!
                         
                          ARTIE
           Oh, so that was your "Mr. Nice
           Guy?"
                         
                          SHREK
           I know, and I'm gonna miss him.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You know what? Why don't you go
           terrorize a village and leave me
           alone?
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, is that some kind of crack
           about ogres? You get your royal
           highness to Far Far Away before I
           kick it there.
                          (TO MERLIN)
           Now which way am I kicking?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oh, I could tell you. But since
           you're in the midst of self-
           destructive rage spiral it would be
           karmic-ly irresponsible.

                          SHREK
           Yeah, I don't think so.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Look pal, it's either that or some
           primal scream therapy.
           Ahhhhhhhhhh!
                         
          Shrek grabs Merlin's mouth and closes it.
                         
                          SHREK

          A fire blazes.
                         
          Merlin throws a handful of dirt into the fire, it flares.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now all of you, look into the "Fire
           of Truth" and tell me what you see!
           Yah! Ha!
           (Wild war cry)
           Woo-looo-looo-looo!
                         
          He points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i.e.
          Rorschach inkblots).
                         
          Puss and Donkey, excited, sit by the fire.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a
           dutch fudge torte with cinnamon
           swirls.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Okay. Monster, go for it.
                         
          Shrek glances at the fire. The stroller from his nightmare
          begins to take shape in the smoke. He blows the image away.
          He covers his fear and changes the subject.
                         
                          SHREK

                          ARTIE
           This is lame.
                         
          Merlin whacks Artie on the back of the head.
                         
                          ARTIE

           You're lame! Now just go for it.
                         
          He tosses more dirt and flames burst up. Artie studies it.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Okay. There's a baby bird and a
           father bird sitting in a nest.
                         
          Merlin starts beating a drum. Artie's expression starts to
          change as he stays focused.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
                         
                          ARTIE
           Wait, the dad just flew away. Why
           did he leave the little bird all
           alone?
                         
          Shrek starts to take this in as he watches. Artie gets more
          worked up.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's trying to fly, but it doesn't
           know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!
                         
          Suddenly, Artie catches what he said. As the smoke drifts
          away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him,
          stunned.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Whew, proper head case you are,

           Whoa.
                         
          Merlin goes back inside. They all stare at Artie.

          Donkey gives Shrek a nudge to go over and talk to Artie.
          Shrek hesitates and Donkey insists.

          Just as he's about to get going, "That's What Friends Are
          For" starts playing loudly from Merlin's security device
          drowning out any conversation. They all turn toward the
          shack where Merlin peeks out.

          Everyone stares at him.
                         
          He sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. It's
          quiet again.

          Artie looks at him.

           Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth
           the trouble. He dumped me at that
           school the first chance he got and
           I never heard from him again.

           My dad wasn't really the fatherly
           type either.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Well, I doubt he was worse than
           mine.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh yeah? My father was an ogre.
           He tried to eat me.
                         
          Artie looks at Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           Now, I guess I should have seen it
           coming. He used to give me a bath
           in barbecue sauce and put me to bed
           with an apple in my mouth.
                         
          Artie chuckles at this.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Okay... I guess that's... pretty

                          SHREK
           You know, it may be hard to believe
           what with my obvious charm and good
           looks, but people used to think
           that I was a monster. And for a
           long time, I believed them.
                         
          Artie looks up at Shrek.

           ignore the names that people call
           you and you just trust who you are.
                         
          Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You know, you're okay, Shrek.
                         
          He tosses the stick into the fire.
                         
                          ARTIE

           The soap's because you stink.
           Really bad.

          The Princesses, Fiona and the Queen are surrounded by

           Well maybe it just bothers you that

          outdoor theater is underway. Two stagehands walk by carrying
          a large dragon set piece. Evil dwarves are busy painting the
          set. The finishing touches are put on the stage tower.

          Behind him a peaceful bird lands on a tree branch. Suddenly,

          One lands and gets his peg-leg stuck in the ground.
                         
          The pirates close in. Shrek grabs one and throws him to the
          side.
                         
          One pirate raises his sword and prepares to swing at Artie.

          the ground. Shrek and Artie share a satisfied look.
                         
          A pirate charges Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ahhh!
                         
          Puss draws his sword and begins fighting off the pirate,
          protecting Donkey.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ha-ha! Argh!
                         
                          PIRATES
           Argh! Argh!
                         
          The camera pans across the back of the piano to reveal Merlin
          happily playing along with Captain Hook. He notices and
          rudely elbows Merlin out of the way.
                         
          A pirate runs at Shrek, only to be tripped by Artie. The
          pirate bounces off Shrek's belly.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ready the plank!
                         
          A wooden board is thrown on a stump, creating a makeshift
          "plank." The pirates back Shrek onto the plank.
                         
          Several pirates with swords force Shrek onto the plank. He
          is backed up to the edge of the plank and falls into a
          waiting treasure chest below. Several pirates try to shut the
          lid on him.
                         
          Puss, Donkey and Artie are trying to hold off the Villains.
          Suddenly, two Evil Trees come into frame and scoop Puss,
          Donkey and Artie up in a net.
                         
          The pirates aim the cannon at Puss, Donkey and Artie. Artie
          starts to panic. Puss extracts his claws and tries to cut
          through the netting.
                         
          The cannon fuse is lit.
                         
          Shrek bursts open the treasure chest and stands up with the
          chest still stuck to his behind.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Shrek!
                         
                          ARTIE
           Help!
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 75.
                         
                         
                         
          Shrek sees the lit fuse and quickly formulates a plan. He
          grabs two pirates and shoves them into the treasure chest.
          He tosses the chest onto the other end of the plank and
          catapults himself over to the cannon. At the last second,
          Shrek is able to aim the cannon in the opposite direction.
          The cannon fires and hits Captain Hook's piano, blowing it
          into pieces.
                         
          Realizing their defeat, the Evil Trees drop the netting that
          holds Donkey, Puss and Artie. The Evil Trees and Pirates
          take off running.
                         
          Captain Hook turns and sees his army running off. He shakes
          his hook in the air.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ya cowards!
                         
                          SHREK
           What has Charming done with Fiona?
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           She's gonna get what's coming to
           her.
                         
          He raises his hook threateningly but it gets caught on an
          Evil Tree's branch and is dragged away with the rest of the
          Villains.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ahhh.
                          (YELLING BACK)
           And there ain't nothing you can do
           to stop him!
                         
          TIGHT ON SHREK, filled with worry. Nothing else matters to
          him now.
                         
          Artie, Puss, and Donkey run over to Shrek.
                         
                          PUSS
           We've got to save her!
                         
                          DONKEY
           But she's so far far away!
                         
          Shrek thinks for a moment.
                         
                          SHREK
           Get yourself back to
           Worcestershire, kid.

                          ARTIE
           No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've
           got an idea.
                         
                         
          EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Merlin is sitting cross-legged, deep in meditation. Artie
          approaches him.
                         
                          MERLIN
                          (CHANTING)
           I'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz,
           buzz...
                         
                          ARTIE
           Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to
           get them...I mean, us, back to Far
           Far Away.
                         
          Merlin stops meditating and looks out of the corner of his
          eye at Artie.
                         
                          MERLIN
                          (GETTING UP)
           Forget it. I don't have that kind
           of magic in me anymore, kid. How
           about a hug instead? Hmm? That's
           the best kind of magic.
                         
          Artie tries a new approach.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Mr. Merlin please. I know you can
                          DO IT-
                         
                          MERLIN
           I said, forget it!
                         
                          ARTIE
                          BUT-
                         
          Merlin turns and starts to walk away muttering under his
          breath.
                         
                          MERLIN (CONT'D)
           Mumble, grumble, interrupt my
           healing. Mumble, mumble.
                         
          Artie thinks for a moment, staring at Merlin. Artie starts
          to sob. Merlin stops and turns around.

                          MERLIN
           Oh. What, what's with you?
                         
          Artie continues to cry.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's just so hard. You know? They
           really need to get back `cause
           their kingdom's in trouble `cause
           there's a really bad man and it's
           just so hard...
                         
          Merlin is visibly uncomfortable.
                         
                          MERLIN
           C'mon, take it easy.
                         
          Artie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable.
                         
                          ARTIE
           No! I don't think you understand!
           There's a mean person doing mean
           things to good people-
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, have a heart old man!
                         
          Artie grabs him, now desperate.
                         
                          ARTIE
           And they really need your help to
           get them back! So why won't you
           help them?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oh.
                         
          Artie speaks one last, indecipherable line.
                         
          Merlin is stunned. He doesn't know what to do.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my
           things.
                         
          Merlin goes into his cave. Artie immediately recovers.
          Shrek is impressed.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Piece of cake.

                          SHREK
           Well, well, well. You want some
           eggs with that ham?
                         
          Shrek smiles.
                         
          Merlin returns holding a spell book.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now, I am a little rusty, so there
           could be some side effects.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Side effects!?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Don't worry, whatever it is, no
           matter how excruciatingly painful
           it may be, it'll wear off
           eventually... I think.
                         
          Merlin cracks his knuckles. A bolt of lighting shoots out
          his hands and blows up a rock next to Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ah!
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oops.
                         
          Donkey and Puss shoot Shrek a pleading look.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Are you sure this is a good idea?
                         
                          SHREK
           Look, if Artie trusts him, that's
           good enough for me. Even if his
           robe doesn't quite cover his-
                         
                          MERLIN

           get back, um... soon!
                         
          Magic rays shoot out of Merlin's fingers. Shrek, Puss,
          Donkey and Artie disappear in a puff of smoke.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Woah! It worked!

          They reappear and fall out of the sky and bounce through the
          canopy of a large apple tree. They ping-pong through the
          foliage and land in a heap at the base of the tree.

          Donkey adjusts himself, feeling hung over.

           What? Is there something in my
           teeth?
                         
          Donkey's eyes widen. He realizes his voice is coming out of
          Puss' body.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Huh? What the?

           Oh no!
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) grabs Puss' hat. He looks down at
          Puss' boots. His tail begins to twitch.
                         
                          DONKEY
           (in Puss' body)
           I've been abracadabra'd into a
           fancy feasting second rate
           sidekick.
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) falls from a tree next to Donkey (in
          Puss' body).

           At least you don't look like some
           kind of bloated roadside pi�ata.
           You really should think about going
           on a diet!

           Yeah, and you should think about
           getting yourself a pair of pants!
           I feel all exposed and nasty.
                         
          Both Shrek and Artie stare at them. A strained smile pasted
          to their faces. They burst out laughing.
                         
          Donkey joins Puss, both of them scowling.

          Puss is fuming.
                         
          Shrek and Artie regain their composure.
                         
                          ARTIE
                          (SNICKERS)
           I'm really sorry guys.
                         
                          SHREK
           Don't be! You got us back kid.
                         
          Shrek motions to Far Far Away, just a few miles ahead of
          them. He turns back to Artie.
                         
          Artie smiles.
                         
          Donkey takes a few awkward steps in Puss' body.

           Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. How in the
           Hans Christian Andersen am I
           supposed to parade around in these
           goofy boots?
                         
                          PUSS
           Be very careful with those - HEE
           HAW!
                         
          Puss is shocked by this. He tries to recover.

          EXT. ENTRANCE TO FAR FAR AWAY - AFTERNOON
                         
          Shrek, Puss (in Donkey's body), and Artie rush past a welcome
          sign to the town that has been boarded over so it now reads
          "Go Go Away."
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) struggles to walk. His tender new
          feet hurt in their tiny boots.
                         
                          DONKEY

           comfort inserts or arch supports or
           something.
           (noticing Rodeo Drive)
           Woah!
                         
          Inside the kingdom, Rodeo Drive is trashed. There is graffiti
          everywhere.
                         
          Suddenly a carriage driven by Evil Witches comes zooming down
          Rodeo Drive.
                         
                          EVIL WITCHES
           Woohoo!!
                         
          The carriage zips around a corner on two wheels. A drunken
          Evil Dwarf is almost hit by the carriage while crossing the
          street.
                         
          Shrek is shocked by what he sees.
                         
          A crash is heard off-screen.
                         
                          EVIL DWARF #1
           Hey... watch it I'm walking here...
           and I'm gonna keep going...
                         
          A large explosion is heard off-screen while Little Red Riding
          Hood pick pockets the Evil Dwarf.
                         
          A carriage wheel on fire rolls by a marionette theatre with
          Pinocchio dancing in it.

          Shrek and the rest rush over as the curtain starts to go down
          on Pinocchio. He presses his puppet hands against the glass.
                         
                          SHREK

                          PINOCCHIO
           Charming and the Villains have
           taken over everything! They
           attacked us but Fiona and the
           Princesses got away. And now she's-
                          -
                         
          The time has run out. The cheesy music stops as the curtain
          goes down.
                         
                          SHREK
           She's what?! She's what!?
                         
          Shrek looks at the marionette theatre and sees how much it
          costs per show.
                         
                          SHREK

           Hold on a second.
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) removes his boot, he turns it over and
          a bag of money falls onto the ground.

           (in Puss' body)
           Aha!
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) tosses the money to Shrek.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           I had no idea ...really ...I swear.
                         
          Shrek quickly dumps the change into the machine. The music
          starts and the curtain goes up again and Pinocchio dances.
                         
                          SHREK
           Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?
                         
                          PINOCCHIO
           Charming's got her locked away some
           place secret. You gotta find him!
           He's probably getting ready for the
                          SHOWWWW---
                         
          The curtain goes down again.
                         
                          SHREK
           Wait, wait, wait! Pinocchio! What
           show?
                         
          Pinocchio's hand comes out from under the curtain and points
          to a poster on the wall. Puss reads the poster out loud.
                         
                          PUSS

           Shrek's final performance.
                         
          The picture shows Charming, sword raised in the air, with his
          foot pinning Shrek, tongue sticking out of his mouth, to the
          ground.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us
           you were in a play.
                         
                          SHREK

           It's the ogre! Get him!
                         
          Shrek turns and sees a large group of Charming's royal
          knights, armed and ready. They drive them back into the
          alley. Puss (in Donkey's body) steps forward.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Don't worry, Jefe. I got this.
                         
          He whips his head towards the oncoming guards. His eyes are
          large and sweet. His lips pout. The guards are momentarily
          hypnotized by his cuteness, until they realize they're
          staring at a donkey.
                         
          The guards recoil.
                         
                          GUARD #2
           Ugh! Kill it!
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) immediately retreats.
                         
          Artie glances at the theater poster on the wall and steps
          forward, confronting the guards.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Look, don't you know who he thinks
           he is? How dare you?
                         
          Shrek picks up on his plan.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey, we're dealing with
           amateurs.
                         
          The guards are confused. Artie tears the poster off the
          wall. Shrek glances at Artie, who steps forward, yanking the
          poster off the wall.
                         
                          ARTIE
           He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so
           sorry about this Mr. Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           I'm gonna lose it!
                         
                          ARTIE
           I assume you have everything ready
           for tonight! You did get the list
           for the dressing room?
                         
          Donkey marches in.

           Oh, and please tell me you at least
           have the saffron corn with the
           jalapeno honey butter cause our

           Uh...Maybe they should talk to
           Nancy in Human Resources.
                         
          Shrek pushes the guards aside and continues on towards the
          castle.
                         
                          PUSS

          A group of enchanted trees work on through their dance
          number.
                         
          Two dwarfs on bungee chords helplessly swing back and forth
          in the rear of the stage.
                         
          The camera lands on Prince Charming reading his lines next to
          a Shrek stand in.

          Without looking, Prince Charming stabs the stand in, who
          falls to the ground.

           Is that the right word? "Smote?"
           "Smooote." Is that even a word
           actually? Maybe I should just
           smite him.
                         
          Unseen stage hands drag the stand-in away.

           Ooh!!!
                         
          Prince Charming does a quick mime of being afraid and
          chuckles.

          Without looking he stabs stand in #2. He falls to the ground.
          Prince Charming is still frustrated.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh! It just doesn't feel real
           enough yet!
                         
          He throws the sword to the ground and turns toward the
          dancing villains who are staring at him.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Who told you to stop dancing?!
                         
                          CYCLOPS

          He throws the script on the ground and notices the stand-in.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           And what are you laying around for?
           Get up! Honestly.
                         
          Prince Charming storms off.

          INT. CHARMING'S DRESSING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Prince Charming storms into his colossal gold leafed dressing
          room, its walls covered with posters of inspirational sayings
          and portraits of Prince Charming in different acting roles.
                         
          Slamming the door, he plops down in his throne chair in front
          of a dressing table and large 3-way mirror. A statuette of
          his mother is on the vanity. He looks at it intently.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Our happily ever after is nearly
           complete, mummy. And I assure you,
           the people of this kingdom will pay
           dearly for every second we've had
           to wait.
                         
                         
                         
          Charming adjusts the mirror, revealing a reflection of Shrek
          standing in the doorway. Artie, Puss and Donkey stand along
          side him.
                         
          Prince Charming quickly stands up and faces Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           Break a leg. Or, on second
           thought, let me break it for you.
                         
          He walks across the room as Prince Charming backs against his
          dressing table.
                         
          Prince Charming fumbles behind his back and pushes a button
          under the counter.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Thank goodness you're here. I was
           beginning to think you might not
           make it back in... time.
                         
          Shrek picks him up by the front of his shirt and scowls.

           Where's Fiona?
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Don't worry. She and the others
           are safe. For now.
                         
          Shrek strengthens his grip.
                         
          Suddenly, a group of guards burst into the room and quickly
          surround Shrek, Artie, Puss and Donkey.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Ow.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles.
                         
          Shrek looks around and realizes he's beat. He drops Charming
          with a thud.
                         
          Prince Charming brushes himself off as the guards surround
          Shrek.
                         
          Prince Charming walks over to Artie. A smile grows across
          his face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Let me guess... Arthur?
                         
          Artie looks indignant. He raises himself up.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's Artie, actually.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           This boy is supposed to be the new
           King of Far Far Away?
                         
          Laughing, Prince Charming draws his sword and holds it up to
          Artie's neck.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           How pathetic! Now, stand still so I
           won't make a mess.
                         
          Shrek steps in.
                         
                          SHREK
           Charming, stop! I'm here now, you
           got what you wanted. This isn't
           about him.
                         
          Artie is confused.

                          ARTIE
           Then who's it about? I'm supposed
           to be King, right?
                         
          Shrek hesitates and then gathers himself.
                         
                          SHREK
           You weren't really next in line for
           the throne, okay? I was.
                         
                          ARTIE
           But you said the King asked for me
           personally.
                         
                          SHREK
           Not exactly.
                         
                          ARTIE
           What's that supposed to mean?
                         
                         
          Shrek becomes defensive.
                         
                          SHREK
           Look, I said whatever I had to say,
           alright! I wasn't right for the
           job, I just needed some fool to
           replace me, and you fit the bill.
           So just go!
                         
          Artie is stunned.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You were playing me the whole time.
                         
          Shrek fights back tears as he punishes Artie more.
                         
                          SHREK
           You catch on real fast kid... Maybe
           you're not as big of a loser as I
           thought.
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) is about to interject when Donkey (in
          Puss' body) covers his mouth and signals him to stay quiet.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You know, for a minute there, I

                          PRINCE CHARMING

          Prince Charming signals the guards to release Artie. He
          stares at Shrek one last time and heads out.
                         
          Shrek lowers his head in shame.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           You really do have a way with
           children, Shrek.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles and the guards lead Shrek off.

          The scene cross-dissolves to Artie's back as he walks away
          from the castle. He gives one last look back, and angrily
          storms away.

          Shrek's ankles and wrists are shackled. Shrek pulls on his
          chains. He sadly looks out the cell window.
                         
                         
          INT. PRISON:
                         
          The scene cross-disolves to another prison window. Fiona
          comes to the window of her prison cell. She stares
          sorrowfully at the castle in the distance.

          Cinderella is frantically scrubbing a spot on the floor to a
          shine.
                         
          Fiona looks out the cell window towards the castle in the
          distance. Behind her, Snow White paces around, complaining.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE

           Yeah, shut up.
                         
          Cinderella looks down at her reflection in the floor.
                         
                          CINDERELLA (REFLECTION)

                          SNOW WHITE
           Who cares who's running the kingdom
           anyway?
                         
                          FIONA
           I care.
                         
          Fiona steps forward and challenges them.
                         
                          QUEEN
           And you should all care too.
                         
          Suddenly, the cell door flies open. Donkey and Puss (in each
          other's bodies) are tossed in as the door is slammed behind
          them.

          Puss, in Donkey's body, hisses and arches his back like a
          cat.

           (in Donkey's body)
           Lo siento, Princessa, but I am

           hideous body.

           Charming's got him, Princess. And
           he plans on killing Shrek tonight
           in front of the whole kingdom.

           Alright everyone, we need to find a
           way out, now.
                         
          The Princesses nod in agreement.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           You're right.
           (to the other Princesses)
           Ladies, assume the position!
                         
          Sleeping Beauty falls asleep standing up. Snow White quickly
          assumes her position by lying down and puckering her lips.
          Cinderella dusts off a spot, sits down and crosses her legs.

                          SNOW WHITE
           Well, what do you expect us to do?
           We're just four...
                          (NOTICES DORIS)
           I mean, three, super hot
           princesses, two circus freaks, a
           pregnant ogre and an old lady.
                         
          The Queen smiles and then casually walks by the Princesses.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hmmm. Excuse me. Old lady coming
           through.
                         
          She walks right up to the brick wall, takes a deep breath and
          lets out a yell.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hiiiyyyiiiaaaah!
                         
          She head-butts a hole right through the brick wall. Fiona
          and the Princesses are impressed.

                          QUEEN
           Well, you didn't actually think you
           got your fighting skills from your
           father, did you?
                         
          Fiona beams at her mother and then turns to the Princesses.
                         
          Snow White points to another wall behind them.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Excuse me, I think there's still
           one more.
                         
          The Queen turns and sees the another wall barring their way.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hmmmm.
                         
          The Queen hurries to the other wall.

           Hiiiiyah!
                         
          It crumbles, revealing the outside. The princesses wince.
                         
          Fiona approaches her mother.
                         
          The Queen turns around, this time a little woozy, singing
          softly to herself.
                         
                          FIONA
           Why don't you just lie down?
                         
          The Queen continues to sing to herself as she walks away.
                         
          Fiona turns to the others.

           Okay girls, from here on out, we're
           gonna take care of business
           ourselves.
                         
          Snow thinks for a moment and then glances at the other
          Princesses. They nod.
                         
          Snow looks determined. She rips off a sleeve, revealing a
          Dopey tattoo.

          Cyclops motions to the shadows.
                         
          CYCLOPS' DAUGHTER walks out from the shadows. She looks like
          Cyclops with long hair and skirt.
                         
          Shrek recoils.

          Evil Trees guard the castle gate. Fiona uses a duck call to
          signal Snow White. She skips down the path toward a side
          entrance, where two Evil Trees are standing guard. Snow
          White stops in front of them, singing our version of: "Animal

          The Guards turn around to find a leg sticking out. They
          "ooh" and "aah" as they approach the leg. The camera pans up
          to reveal Doris.

                          NOT-
                          (SINGING)
           "FamiliaAAAAAAR!"
                         
          He holds the last, highest note. Shrek winces. Goblets, eye
          glasses, a glass tiara and glass pearls all break in the
          audience.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles. Shrek looks at him with contempt.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well it can't be anymore painful
           than the lousy performance you're
           giving.
                         
          The audience laughs at Shrek's remark. Prince Charming is
          thrown by their reaction.
                         
          From a trap door underneath the stage Rumplestiltskin tries
          to help Prince Charming out by feeding him his next line.
                         
                          RUMPLESTILTSKIN
           "Prepare foul beast."
                         
          He clears his throat and tries to get back into character.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (SINGING)
           "Prepare foul beast, your time is
           done."
                         
                          SHREK
           Oooh, if you don't mind could you
           kill me, and then sing?

          The audience laughs. Prince Charming gets in Shrek's face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Be quiet!
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, come on, I'm just havin' fun
           with ya. That's actually a very
           nice leotard.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Thank you.
                         
                          SHREK
           Do they come in men's sizes?
                         
          The audience laughs again.
                         
                          HOOK
           He, he. Now that be funny.
                         
          The crowd laughs again. Shrek smiles, enjoying how he's
          screwing up the show. Prince Charming is furious.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           ENOUGH!
                         
          The crowd falls silent.
                         
          Prince Charming turns back to Shrek.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Now you'll finally know what it's
           like to have everything you've
           worked for, everything that's
           precious to you taken away.
                         
          Prince Charming raises his sword.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           Now you'll know how I felt.
                         
          Suddenly a fireball hits the blade, melting it.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ahhhhh!
                         
          Another huge fireball spreads across the sky as Dragon flies
          above the theater. The Dronkeys follow behind her.
                         
                          DRAGON

          The Three Pigs come running down the aisle.
                         
                          PIG #1
           Sausage Roll!!
                         
          The Three Pigs leap onto the stage, going into a drop and
          roll move to land in between Shrek and Prince Charming. They
          strike a fighting pose.
                         
          Pinocchio comes flying in on his strings, landing with a
          flurry of kung-fu hands.
                         
          The Wolf unzips the wolf costume, steps out and joins the
          others.
                         
                          WOLF

          Gingerbread Man pops up in the tower window, grabs Rapunzel's
          hair and swings down. Before he hits the ground, the end
          catches and he bounces like a bungee jumper. Her hair falls
          into a pile next to a very surprised Gingerbread Man.
                         
          Rapunzel screams. Her mousy brown hair crammed under a hair
          net. She runs off crying.
                         
          Prince Charming looks around, almost surrounded.
                         
          Suddenly a shadow falls over the crowd and they gasp. Dragon
          and the Dronkeys fly in and land on the stage.
                         
          Puss and Donkey leap off her back to the stage.

           ...Puss!
                         
          He claps his hooves on the stage.
                         
                          DONKEY

          He carves a letter "D" on Pinocchio's bottom.

          The Queen head-butts through one of the backdrops, with
          Sleeping Beauty and Doris. Snow White flies in behind them
          with the help of her woodland creatures ("Crouching Tiger,
          Hidden Dragon" style). Cinderella runs on stage equipped with
          a mop as her weapon. Together, the Princesses strike fierce
          poses and stand next to Shrek.
                         
          The audience applauds.
                         
          Suddenly the front door of the "swamp house" set crashes to
          the floor, revealing Fiona.
                         
                          FIONA
           Hi honey! Sorry we're late. You
           okay?
                         
                          SHREK
           Much better, now that you're here.
                         
                          AUDIENCE
           Awwwwwww!
                         
          The audience applauds. Shrek turns to Prince Charming
          raising his shackled wrists.
                         
                          SHREK
           So Charming, you wanna let me out
           of these so we can settle this ogre
           to man?
                         
          Prince Charming considers this for a second.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oooh, that sounds fun. But I have
           a better idea!
                         
          Prince Charming strikes an imperious pose and claps his
          hands. Cyclops suddenly emerges from the trap door, knocking
          Puss and Donkey down. He approaches them menacingly.
                         
          The witches fly in and threaten the princesses with their
          brooms. The Evil Queen rises up behind the Queen and puts a
          knife to her throat.
                         
          The Evil Dwarves grab The Three Pigs. Gingerbread Man is
          suddenly surrounded by many Evil Knights. He poops out a gum-
          ball.
                         
          Dragon starts to move forward only to find herself surrounded
          by crossbows. A bunch of pirates grab Fiona and tie her up.
                         
                          SHREK

           No! Let go of me!
                         
          Shrek struggles to free himself of the chains, but it's no
          use.
                         
          Prince Charming's eyes narrow.

           Kill it!
                         
          Prince Charming signals to the villains to attack Shrek. As
          the villains advance towards Shrek, a spotlight shines in
          their eyes, stopping them in their tracks.

           Artie?
                         
          Artie jumps from the spotlight.
                         
          Artie lands clumsily on a hanging cloud.
                         
          Artie leaps awkwardly from cloud to cloud. The audience
          stares in awe.
                         
          After one last leap, he swings down on the Cherub's cable,
          sending the little person up in the air.
                         
          Artie lands on the stage in between the Villains and Shrek.
          He stands facing the Villains.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Who really thinks we need to settle
           things this way?
                         
          The Evil Knights think about it and raise their hands. The
          other Villains follow suit.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You're telling me you just want to
           be Villains your whole lives?
                         
          This gives the Villains pause.

           I'm not a talking tree. But, ya
           know, a good friend of mine once
           told me that just because people

          Artie shares a look with Shrek.

          The Headless Horseman breaks through the crowd.
                         
                          HEADLESS HORSEMAN
           I've always wanted to play the
           flute.
                         
          The Fairy-tale Villains and Creatures look at each other.
          The Evil Queen steps up.
                         
                          EVIL QUEEN
           I`d like to open up a spa in
           France.
                         
          The Villains nod in agreement.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           I grow daffodils!
                         
          Complete silence as everyone stares at Hook.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           And they're beautiful!
                         
          Captain Hook looks thoughtfully at his sword, then throws it
          down.

          The pirates throw theirs down, followed by the witches and
          Evil Knights. The evil knight holding Pinocchio is thinking
          about it when Pinocchio reaches over and takes the ax from
          him. The weapons pile up in the middle of the stage. Everyone
          else cheers and starts to mingle, introducing themselves and
          shaking hands.
                         
          Gingerbread Man high fives with an Evil Knight. Fiona is
          untied.
                         
          Mabel walks up to Doris and lightly punches her on the jaw.
          Doris returns the sign of affection by punching Mabel in the
          jaw, but a bit too hard, sending her falling to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, Prince Charming kicks himself free of the Evil Tree
          and charges them. He grabs a sword from the discard pile and
          raises it up, his aim set at Artie.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Aaaahhhh!
                         
          Despite his fear, Artie faces Prince Charming bravely. As
          Prince Charming charges, Shrek finds the strength to break
          his chains. Just before Prince Charming strikes, a chain
          whips into frame, wrapping around the sword. Shrek pulls
          Prince Charming around in a circle, away from Artie. Furious,
          he charges Shrek and stabs him with the sword. Charming lets
          go and Shrek stumbles back with the weapon impaled in him,
          and falls to the floor, groaning.
                         
          Prince Charming beams, and laughs. He turns to the audience.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           A new era finally begins!
                         
          The audience cowers.
                         
          Shrek looks up smiling and nods at Fiona and Artie.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Now, all of you, bow before your
           king!
                         
          Shrek casually rises up behind him and clears his throat.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah-hem.
                         
          Charming turns around. Shrek lifts his arm revealing that he
          was never really stabbed.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)

          Charming is stunned.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           This was supposed to be my happily
           ever after.
                         
          Prince Charming is paralyzed. Shrek drops the sword and grabs
          him by the shirt-front, lifting him off of his feet.
                         
          He winces, but is still defiant.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well I guess you need to keep
           looking...
                         
          Shrek looks at Fiona and at his friends and smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
           ...cause I'm not giving up mine.
                         
          Shrek sets Prince Charming down and signals DRAGON. She
          casually tips the tower over with her tail. A shadow falls
          over Prince Charming. He turns and sees the tower falling
          toward him, his body perfectly framed up in the princesses's
          window.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Mommy?
                         
          It crashes down and he's trapped inside.
                         
          As the dust clears, the crown rolls across the stage. Artie
          stops it with his foot and slowly picks it up.
                         
                          SHREK
           It's yours if you want it, you
           know, but this time it's your
           choice.
                         
          Artie considers it.
                         
          He looks at Shrek, who is smiling proudly at him.
                         
          Artie turns to the audience and holds out the crown to them.
          They cheer him.
                         
          Artie places the crown on his head. The crowd goes nuts. In
          the audience, Raul sobs with joy.
                         
                          ALL

          Everybody cheers as the Fairy-tale Creatures and Villains put
          Artie up on their shoulders and carry him off. Donkey and
          Puss, still in each other's bodies, watch as Artie gets
          carried away.
                         
          In a puff of smoke, Merlin suddenly appears. He looks around
          confused, clutching his show ticket.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, excuse me, that's my seat.
                         
          Suddenly he is thrown back against the front of the stage as
          Donkey and Puss confront him.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Okay, senor hocus-y pocus-y. The
           time has come to rectify some
           wrongs!
                         
                          DONKEY

           Although I have been enjoying these
           "cat baths."
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Please say you didn't.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh... alright, alright...look..
                         
          Merlin rubs his hands together.
                         
                          MERLIN
           You're gonna feel a little pinch,
           and possibly some lower intestinal
           discomfort, but this should do the
           trick.
                         
          Merlin rolls up his sleeves, and prepares to make with the
          magic. He lets loose with a bright burst of magic. It takes a
          moment for Donkey and Puss to recover. They eye each other
          cautiously.
                         
                          PUSS
           Are you..?
                         
          Donkey lifts his hoof and inspects it carefully.
                         
                          DONKEY

          Puss checks out his own paws.
                         
                          PUSS
           And I am not you!
                         
          Donkey and Puss give each other a big hug.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Alright!
                         
          The two of them turn and walk away together.
                         
          Merlin is behind them, smoking fingers and all. Suddenly his
          eyes grow wide.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oops. Ah, never mind.
                         
          We see that Donkey still has Puss' tail and Puss had
          Donkey's. Merlin slips away.
                         
          Shrek and Fiona watch Artie in the distance.

           Well, for what it's worth, you
           would have too.
                         
          Shrek smiles, and touches Fiona's belly.
                         
                          SHREK
           I have something much more
           important in mind.
                         
          They kiss.
                         
          The camera pulls back to see everyone celebrating around
          Shrek and Fiona as they kiss.

          Shrek grabs a "gourd" bottle and creates an ogre shake out of
          slug juice, eye balls and worms. He walk over to join Fiona
          by the fire.

          Shrek gives Fiona the "gourd" bottle and she places a nipple
          on it. Two ogre babies crawl up onto Fiona's lap.

          A third ogre baby appears at Shrek's feet. He bends down to
          pick him up.
                         
          One big happy family of five. Shrek laughs and gives the
          babies and Fiona a hug.
                         
          The front door opens up to reveal Puss and Donkey.

          The Dronkeys come swarming in behind Donkey. Dragon peers in
          through the door.
                         
          Shrek with a safety pin in his mouth is doing his best at
          changing diapers. He twists the diaper around and the baby
          goes flying off screen and lands in a diaper that Fiona is
          holding. She smiles at Shrek.
                         
          The swamp house is overrun with Dronkeys, ogre babies and
          dirty diapers.
                         
          Puss sits next to an ogre baby that has a pacifier in his
          mouth. He takes the pacifier out of his mouth, shoves it in
          Puss' mouth and gives Puss a big hug. Another baby comes
          crawling into frame and starts to tug on Puss' tail. A tug
          of war ensues.
                         
          The ogre babies are bathing in a pot of water (a la a beat
          from the Nightmare scene). One of the babies farts in the
          water as Shrek comes in and scoops them up. Shrek laughs.

          A baby ogre pulls ear wax from Shrek's ear. The baby uses
          the wax to draw squiggly lines on a piece of paper.

          The Queen is bouncing a baby ogre on her lap. The baby pukes
          and the Queen smiles.
                         
          There is a knock at the door. Donkey is laying on the floor
          holding a bottle with all four hooves, drinking the milk.
                         
          Shrek grabs the bottle out of Donkey's mouth.

            "Shrek Forever After"

It was opened up to a page of Far Far Away with King Harold and Queen Lillian holding their newborn as a man was heard narrating.

Man's Voice: Once upon a time a long time ago, a king and a queen had a beautiful daughter named Fiona.

The pages flipped to one page of older Fiona's human form during the day, and her ogre form during the night.

Man's Voice: But she was possessed by a terrible curse. By day, a lovely princess; by night, a hideous ogre.

The pages then turned to the pages with a knight kneeling, holding a bouquet of flowers and Fiona waiting in the tower guarded by a certain dragon's tail.

Man's Voice: Only true love's kiss would lift her curse. So Fiona waited in a tower, guarded by a dragon, until the day when her true love would arrive.

The next pages showed Harold and Lillian in a carriage, racing away from their safe kingdom and into the dark, foreboding forest.

Man's Voice: But as the days turned into years, the King and Queen were forced to resort to more desperate measures.

(Flashback)

Years ago, before Harold and Lillian had reunited with their daughter, the horses pulling the carriage that carried the king and queen raced through the forest like mad. Inside the carriage, the king and queen held each others' hands in worry. The carriage then arrived towards an even more eerie part of the forest. It was Crone's Nest Carriage Park, a medieval trailer park. The signs underneath the main said "No Vacancy" and "Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here". Two witches guarding recognized the royal carriage and opened the gates, allowing the carriage inside. The carriage slowed down and was pulled more cautiously, and as that happened, the king and queen looked at all the witches inhabiting the area near their broken down carriages. One witch sneered, while stroking a black cat she held, and many other black cats, that she hoarded, all snarled. King Harold yelped a bit. Then he and Lillian saw another witch dumping out trash from the window of her carriage, while one witch standing by, smirking, as she made a kissy noise to the king.

King Harold: Ew!

Then he and Lillian saw a family of hillbilly-type witches, playing mandolins, spitting tobacco, holding a bottle of moonshine and giving dirty, foul looks at the visitors, while a bare-butted baby witch was crawling on the ground. The royal couple were deeply unsettled as Lillian locked the carriage door.

Driver: (pulls reigns) Whoa, there!

The horses stopped at a huge egg-like carriage with an "R" on top.

King Harold: I don’t know about this, Lillian. Fairy Godmother said only true love’s kiss could break Fiona’s curse.

Queen Lillian: I don’t trust that woman, Harold. This may be our last hope. Besides, he does come highly recommended by King Midas.

King Harold: But to put our daughter’s life in the hands of this…person? He’s devious. He’s deceitful. He’s...he’s…

A bit later, the king and queen were inside the carriage as the owner spun around in his chair, revealing himself. He was Rumpelstiltskin.

Rumpelstiltskin: Rumpelstiltskin, at your service!

Lightning flashed at the mention of his name. His pet goose, Fifi, honked a bit. The little man kissed the uneasy Lillian's hand in respect.

Rumpelstiltskin: Mrs. Highness.

She chuckled nervously a bit, pulling her hand away.

Queen Lillian: How do you do?

Fifi then hissed at Harold, startling him.

Rumpelstiltskin: Down, Fifi. Get down!

The goose did as her master said and went off to the side. Then the deal maker rolled out a contract he had for the royal couple to sign.

Rumpelstiltskin: As you can see, everything’s in order.

King Harold: So you’ll put an end to our daughter’s curse?

Rumpelstiltskin: And, in return, you sign the kingdom of Far Far Away (gives a menacing look) over to me.

Lightning flashed again, and King Harold gasped at what the short man said. Lightning flashed even when it showed Fifi. The royal couple turned as Harold spoke quietly to his wife, while Rumpelstiltskin just listened in, giving a fiendish smirk.

King Harold: Lillian, this is madness!

Queen Lillian: What choice do we have? Fiona has been locked away in that tower far too long.

Rumpelstiltskin: It’s not like she’s getting any younger.

King Harold: But to sign over our entire kingdom?

Rumpelstiltskin: (pulls contract away) Well, if your kingdom’s worth more to you than your daughter…

The king angrily stopped the paper.

King Harold: Nothing is worth more to us than our daughter.

Rumpelstiltskin: I thought not.

So Rumpelstiltskin slammed the windows shut and got out a drawer of jars of magic ink, slammed one jar down and clapped his hands.

Rumpelstiltskin: Jump, Fifi, jump!

The goose jumped in his arms and he yanked a feather out of her behind, making the king cringe in disgust. He then dipped the feather's end into the magic ink, with a small magic cloud appearing as Harold took the feather from him.

Rumpelstiltskin: Just sign it and all your problems will disappear.

Lightning flashed for dramatic effect once more, as he slid the contract towards them. Harold was about to sign it, while Rumpelstiltskin eagerly and anxiously waited. The king hesitated a bit as he looked at his wife, who nodded seriously. So Harold proceeded to sign it, but before he could, the carriage's door was burst open and the royal messenger was there, out of breath.

Messenger: Your Highness! The Princess! She’s been saved!

Harold and Lillian gasped happily, while Rumpelstiltskin was shocked.

Rumpelstiltskin: Huh?!

The king turned, giving a smirk as he ripped the contract up, to the deal maker's dismay.

Rumpelstiltskin: (lip trembling) Who saved her?

(End of Flashback)

In the present, the book was finished being read by the certain foiled deal maker, who was the one narrating. The next pages showed Shrek roaring, scaring away villagers, and then the helmeted Shrek carrying Fiona over his back while he and Donkey ran away from Dragon and the fire she breathed. Donkey's tail was even on fire.

Rumpelstiltskin: No one would have guessed that an ogre named Shrek, whose roar was feared throughout the land, would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.

He angrily turned the page, showing a picture of Shrek and Fiona (as an ogre) kissing and a separate picture of their babies.

Rumpelstiltskin: (irate) True love’s kiss led to marriage and ogre babies!

He ripped off the page of the babies, showing the page of good guys and villains (who were reformed thanks to Artie) holding hands together.

Rumpelstiltskin: The kingdom of Far Far Away was finally at peace. (sarcastically) Goody for them!

He ripped off that page as well, leaving the page with the ogre family in front of the swamp.

Rumpelstiltskin: (furiously) AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY--

He ripped off that page, leaving the page of Shrek with Donkey and Puss bumping fists.

Rumpelstiltskin: EVER--

He ripped off that page, getting to the final one with Shrek and Fiona riding a unicorn, while Pinocchio waved a wand, Donkey ran with his kids, the Three Little Pigs, the Three Blind Mice, Puss and Gingy riding down rainbows, and the ogre babies riding a cloud.

Rumpelstiltskin: AFTER!!

He ripped out that as well, and fumed while clenching the page in fist. He was shown to be reading the book in a library. Then, Pinocchio, wearing an apron, appeared and saw what he was doing.

Pinocchio: Sir? You’re gonna have to pay for that.

He quickly realized he ripped a book that didn't belong to him, as he turned to the wooden puppet.

Rumpelstiltskin: (stutters) M-m-maybe we could make a deal for it, little boy?

Pinocchio: Oh, I’m not a real boy.

Rumpelstiltskin: (smirks) Do you want to be?

The next thing you know, Rumpelstiltskin was booted out of the library by Pinocchio, screaming as he face-planted into the dirty sidewalk.

Pinocchio: Nobody needs your deals anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

He shut the door as the coughing former deal maker looked at the final page of the book and picked it up, looking at it with anger.

Rumpelstiltskin: (darkly) I wish that ogre was never born!

In the certain swamp home of our ogre hero, another day was beginning as we see the same "Beware of Ogres" sign, now with the pictures of the ogre baby triplets added, and a swing set and small slide were added in the yard. Inside the home, Shrek and Fiona were asleep in their bed until awakened by a squeaking noise. They looked and saw their babies at the foot of the bed, with Felicia squeaking a squeaky toy.

Felicia: Wake up, Daddy, wake up!  

Fiona: Good morning.

Shrek: Good morning to you too.

The ogres kissed.

After getting up and dressed, Shrek was in his arm-chair with his kids, each drinking swamp juice from their own sippy cup, and each gave a small belch.

Fiona: (passes by) Better out than in.

Shrek: (chuckles) That’s MY line.

A bit later, Shrek brought Fergus over to the changing table.

Shrek: Did my little Fergus make a…(jumps back) WHOA! (waves hand in front of face) Big, grownup ogre stink?!

Some time after changing Fergus, Shrek went outside with the full rotten diaper, heading to the diaper pale.

Shrek: Oh, that’s diabolical!

He dumped it in, and then he took a newspaper, heading to the outhouse. At this time, a bus-sized chariot known as the "Star Tours Chariot" appeared, with a tour guide and tourists here to see the famous ogre.

Tour Guide: (through megaphone) And on your left, the lovable lug that showed us you don’t have to change your undies to change the world!

The ogre gave an annoyed look before closing the door to the outhouse.

Tour Guide: (through megaphone) I wonder what Shrek’s up to in there.

Next, Shrek was trying to fit a little shoe onto Farkle's foot, with Farkle moving his little legs around, and was having trouble trying to put it on.

Shrek: Get in there. Get…it's impossible to put on!

Fiona then showed up and thought she would help. So she placed it on her son's foot.

Fiona: Okay, (begins tying) the dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop, and finally, into the castle.

The parents then blew on their baby's cheeks. A bit later, Shrek thought he'd have some time to himself so he sat in his armchair with a glass of eyeball-tini in his hand, and just when he was about to sip it, a certain donkey popped his head through the window.

Donkey: Play date!

The startled ogre yelped as he fell back. Then Donkey and his kids came in to spend time with Shrek and his family.

Donkey: (singing) Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall All you've got to do is call!

That night, at dinner, Puss flipped in the air and landed on the dinner table, finishing a story being told to the kids.

Puss: Then Shrek kissed the Princess. She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived…

Donkey: Happily…

Fiona: Ever…

Shrek: After.

The kids all jumped and cheered. After the guests left and the triplets were put to sleep, Shrek took some dishes from the table and headed to where Fiona was washing some dishes at the sink next to the window. Fiona then saw a star whizzing by.

Fiona: Look! A shooting star!

She closed her eyes, scrunched up her nose and crossed her fingers.

Shrek: So, what did you wish for?

Fiona: That every day could be like this one.

Shrek: Come here, you.

The two then embraced and kissed, while Puss sat on the side of the window, playing a guitar as he sang a tender song.

Puss: (singing) One love One heart Let's get together and feel alright

The next morning, Shrek was awakened the same way he was yesterday: by the squeaking of his kids' squeaky toy.

Felicia: Morning, Daddy.

Fiona: Morning.

So, the events from yesterday began to happen again, starting with Shrek burping his babies. The boys belched, but Felicia broke wind.

Fiona: (passes by) Better out than in.

Next, it was changing time.

Shrek: Did my little Fergus make a…

Before he could finish, a fountain of fluid sprayed at his face and even got into his mouth, but thankfully, it was coming from a goldfish Fergus squirted water from as he giggled.

Shrek: (takes the fish) Cute. Real cute.

He took the fish and dropped it back in the goldfish bowl. Then, after taking the diaper to the pail outside, he went to the outhouse with the tourist chariot arriving again, to his annoyance.

Tour Guide: (through megaphone) This lovable lug taught us you don’t have to change your undies to change the world!

He slammed the door. Later, he hoped to have some alone time and drink his eyeball-tini in his armchair, but Donkey showed up again.

Donkey: Play date!

He and his kids barged in, and as he sang, the dronkeys flew around, chasing the giggling ogre babies.

Then, Shrek decided to relax in the mud pit outside, but suddenly Fiona came outside.

Fiona: (calls out) Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!

Shrek's eyes widened.

That night, the story that was told at dinner the previous night was told again.

Puss: She turned into a beautiful ogre and they lived…

Donkey: Happily…

Fiona: Ever…

Shrek: (confused) After?

Then the routine happened again with Shrek being woken up by his babies and the squeaky toy, and this time, the triplets were in the bed between the parents, with Farkle pounding Shrek, who looked like he barely got any sleep.

Felicia: Daddy, get up!

Fergus: Morning.

Next, it was time for burping. All three burped, one by one, but then broke wind simultaneously.

Fiona: (passes by) Better out than in.

After Shrek tossed the diaper away, the tourists visited yet again.

Tour Guide: (through megaphone) This lovable lug…

Shrek slammed the door of the outhouse. Then Donkey barged in through the door with his kids flapping in.

Donkey: (excitedly) PLAY DATE!

Shrek: (gets knocked over) No!

The Dronkeys floated while carrying the babies, with some fussing. Then, as Shrek, with a towel around himself, tried to get to the mud pit for some relaxation, Fiona called out again.

Fiona: (calls out) Outhouse again!

He winced. Then, another day, we see Shrek trying to fit the shoe onto Farkle.

Shrek: Come on. Ow!!

His son then kicked him in the chin. Next, we see instances of the babies drinking and belching, and of Shrek throwing a diaper away in the pale in the Winter, on a rainy day, and in the Spring. One day, the tourist chariot returned, knocking the outhouse over while Shrek was on the john.

Tour Guide: (through megaphone) Undies!

When it was playdate time, Shrek just stood frozen in the middle of the chaos that was the Dronkeys and ogres rough-housing, and one of the Dronkeys breathing fire. Then, he tried for the pit again, but didn't make it very far when Fiona's voice called out.

Fiona's Voice: Outhouse!

He walked back in annoyance. We then see the babies bouncing in bed with Felicia hitting her dad softly with her toy, but Shrek was lying on the floor and did not make any motion.

Felicia: Get up, get up!

Finally, it was the dinner/story portion of the seemingly repetitive cycle.

Puss: And they lived…

Donkey: Happily…

Fiona: Ever…

Shrek: (monotone) After.

Later, everyone was asleep, all except for Shrek, who was awake by all the same routine everyday. He rubbed his face with his hands, sighing a bit. He looked at Fiona, sound asleep, before getting up and walking to a dresser. There, he opened up a drawer with a folded up piece of paper inside. He unfolded it, revealing it to be an old Wanted poster of him back from before he met Donkey, rescued Fiona and all his other adventures happened. He looked glum, not feeling as if he was a real ogre anymore. He hung the poster up on the corner of the mirror, and then he looked at the mirror, trying to see if he had any of it inside him.

Shrek: (softly) Roar. Roooooooaaaarr.

It was no use though, he didn't even scare himself. He hanged his head, feeling his days as an ogre were truly gone. The next day, he looked uneasy as he, his family and Donkey were riding Dragon, with Puss at the edge, playing "King of the World", and the Dronkeys were flying at her side, as the song "Isn't It Strange" by Scissor Sisters played. Shrek was carrying a back case full of baby supplies on his back. The babies whooped and laughed with excitement as Dragon soared through the clouds. The wind then pushed Puss back towards Donkey, and Felicia pulled on one Dronkey's tail, making her unintentionally shoot out flames at her brother's tail. He yelped and glared at his sister, thinking it was on purpose, before chasing her. He breathed fire at her, almost hitting her and barely blackening Shrek's snout. The group then arrived in Far Far Away, passing the kingdom's Hollywood-like sign, and came down for a landing near the Candy Apple (formerly known as the Poison Apple until the villains reformed), and everyone was unloading their baggage and getting off the dragon.

Donkey: Nice landing, honey.

He and his wife kiss.

Donkey: And remember, no eating the valet.

Fiona then placed each of her babies on a Dronkey, and they were flown around for fun. As Puss carried a whole stack of presents for the triplets, since it was their birthday, Shrek was carrying down a fold-out three-in-one stroller.

Puss: Happy Birthday, ninos! Vamos a la fiesta!

He set the three-in-one stroller down and tried unfolding them in frustration, but was having trouble. Then, to his further annoyance, some villagers ran over to him with pitchforks and torches, but not the way people used to. In fact, they were grinning.

Villagers: Hey, Shrek! Shrek!

Villager 1: (holds up his pitchfork's handle) Mr. Shrek, will you sign our pitchforks?

Villager 2: (holds up his torch) And our torches?

Shrek quickly dodged the torch as it nearly touched him.

Villager 3: Man, you used to be so fierce!

Villager 2: Yeah, when you were a real ogre.

Shrek: (puzzled) A REAL ogre?

He did not like what that villager was implying. A bit later, inside, Pinocchio was dancing on a stage in front of four animatronics.

Pinocchio: (singing) Happy Birthday Bash! No more diaper rash! One year older, not a pain Friends still remain the same, refrain. Super duper, party pooper! Birthday, birthday, birthday bash! Birthday, birthday, birthday bash!

Then everyone else inside, minus Shrek, who was holding Felicia and Fergus, sang along.

All (minus Shrek): (singing) Birthday Bash! Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!

All those who sang laughed and cheered, and Farkle imitated Pinocchio's dancing a bit. Donkey noticed Shrek not singing, laughing or cheering.

Donkey: Come on, Shrek, it’s a sing-along. You’ve got to sing along!

Shrek: No, thanks.

Donkey: Please? I’ll be your best friend.

Shrek: Why does being your best friend entail me doing everything I don’t want to do?

As he talked, Felicia squeaked her toy right in her father's ear.

Shrek: (puts her toy down) Please, Felicia, not in daddy's ear.

Then a father tapped Shrek on the shoulder.

Butterpants's Father: Excuse me, Mr. Shrek? Could you do that ogre roar of yours for my son? He’s a big, big fan.

Next to him stood his son, a chubby little boy with a grumpy-looking straight face and lollipop in his fist.

Butterpants: Do the roar.

Shrek: You know, I’d rather not. It’s my kids’ birthday party.

Butter Pants: Do the roar.

Fiona then came by and took Fergus off Shrek to hold him for a little bit.

Fiona: Honey? Why don't you go check on the cake?

Shrek: (sighs) Sure.

He went to go check on the birthday cake.

Fiona: And don’t forget the candles.

At the kitchen area, the Muffin Man was finishing putting some decoration on Gingy's legs.

Muffin Man: Hold still.

Once Gingy was done, he stood up with his legs frosted, appearing to look like chaps and he even wore a cowboy hat made of frosting to boot.

Gingy: Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man. I always wanted chaps! (prances around) Yee-haw! Giddy up!

Shrek then arrived at the counter.

Muffin Man: (grins) Ah, Monsieur Shrek.

Gingy: Howdy, Shrek!

The baker then got out a tray holding a frosted cake, decorated with a cutesy grinning ogre head with candy corn for teeth.

Muffin Man: Your cake. Voila!

Shrek was appalled by this.

Shrek: What is that supposed to be?

Gingy: That’s Sprinkles the Ogre!

Doris, wearing party service clothes, and picking up some plates, spoke.

Doris: Isn’t he cute? He looks just like you.

Donkey: Except happy. It’s a party, Shrek. You gotta cheer up!

Shrek, still feeling bitter, started carrying the cake away.

Shrek: (through his teeth) I’m in a great mood, actually.

Donkey: (excitedly) Oh, I’m gonna lick me a rainbow!

So he licked the cake.

Shrek: Donkey!

Then Butterpants and his father appeared next to him again.

Butterpants's Father: As long as you’re not doing anything, how about one of those famous Shrek roars?

Butterpants: Do the roar.

Shrek: Let me set you straight, Butterpants. An ogre only roars when he’s angry. (chuckles a bit) You don’t want to see me angry, do you?

Butterpants: Do it.

He licked his lollipop, while Shrek just walked away, trying to keep his anger in.

Shrek: (to himself) Hold it together. Just hold it together.

Butterpants: Daddy, he’s getting away. Do something.

He set the cake down at the table Fiona was at.

Fiona: Oh good.

She then saw the cake with a big smear over it, thanks to Donkey's licking.

Fiona: (gasps) What happened to the cake?

Shrek: Trust me, it's an improvement.

Queen Lillian: (sees the cake) You licked it!

Shrek: No.

Queen Lillian: Just because you’re an ogre, doesn’t mean you have to eat like one.

Mabel, wearing service clothes as well, walked by.

Mabel: Looks like you forgot the candles.

Wolf walked by blowing up a balloon until it popped, startling Shrek.

Fiona: OK, just watch the cake. I'll go get them.

Fiona went to get the candles.

Shrek: (confused) "Watch the cake"?

He turned and to his alarm, he saw that the cake was gone, and there was nothing left but a couple crumbs.

Shrek: Ahh! Where's the cake?!

The pigs stood there with frosting on their lips, looking guilty.

Heimlich: We ate ze cake.

Dieter: Ja.

Shrek: (shocked) What?

Then his babies started crying a bit, probably because they heard that the pigs ate the cake.

Shrek: No, no. Don't cry, shhh.

Butterpants's Father: Hey! I believe you promised my son a roar.

Butterpants: Do the roar.

Shrek: Uh...(unconvincingly) roar.

Butterpants: Don't like it.

Shrek: Pigs, we need another cake.

Heimlich: But we ate thee other cakes.

The babies cried some more, and Shrek tried calming them down by bouncing them.

Butterpants's Father: Come on, man. One roar!

Donkey: Hey, everybody. Shrek’s gonna do his famous ogre roar!

The Dronkeys gathered around their dad, excited for uncle Shrek's roar.

Shrek: Not now, Donkey. Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

Dieter: We ate them, too.

Heimlich: Zhey have lollipops.

Horst: No, I ate them.

Dieter: What you didn’t share?

Horst: (frowns) Well, you didn’t share the croissants!

The babies cried some more.

Shrek: Everything's gonna be okay.

Fiona came and took her kids, holding them.

Fiona: Shrek, what's going on?

Next, Butterpants was hugging Donkey.

Donkey: Come on, Shrek! Your fans are waiting.

Butterpants: Do the roar.

Pinocchio ran around Shrek, singing and shouting indistinctly. Wolf blew another balloon up until it popped. Then everyone all spoke or made noises at once. All of this pressure and tension going on today was taking a toll on Shrek enough, he was losing his patience, trying his best to fight it.

Crowd: We need the cake! (chanting) Cake! Cake! Cake!

Shrek couldn't hold it in any longer, so he let out an enormous, furious ogre roar that nearly blew everyone away, even Butterpants's hat was blown off.

Shrek: RRRROOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!!

Once he was done, he panted and everyone else was left stunned and silent for a bit until they all cheered.

Butterpants: (chuckles as he hugs his dad) I love you, daddy.

Wolf then slapped a party hat onto Shrek's head, to his annoyance.

Puss: Everybody, I have found...

He lifted his cape to reveal another cake decorated like the last one.

Puss: (finishes) another cake!

Everyone, minus Fiona, started chanting Shrek's name as Shrek stared angrily at the cake, fuming.

Most of everyone: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

The concerned Fiona just noticed the look on her husband as he handed Felicia to her mother.

Fiona: Shrek? Are you okay?

Shrek continued glaring at the adorable ogre picture on the cake, feeling it mocked him.

Most of everyone: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

Shrek then slammed his big fist into the cake's center, making everyone gasp in shock. He all gave a miserable stare at everybody and even Fiona, who was more stunned than anyone else. Then he stormed out of the diner in anger. Everyone else just stood, stunned. Even Gingy was stunned as his frosting chaps fell off.

Outside, a familiar washed-up deal maker was in the trash, looking for scraps, as he saw a plate and licked it, trying to get some flavor. Then he heard the door slam as he hid, but saw Shrek storm out, with Fiona following.

Fiona: Unbelievable.

Shrek: Tell me about it! Those villagers…

Fiona: I’m not talking about the villagers, Shrek. I’m talking about you. Is this really how you want to remember the kids’ first birthday?

Shrek: Oh, great. So this is all my fault?

Fiona: Yes. But you know what? Let’s talk about this after the party, at home.

Shrek: You mean that roadside attraction we live in? (mockingly) Step right up! (does a mocking jolly dance) See the dancing ogre! Don’t worry! He won’t bite!

He then took off the party hat, smashed it and threw it to the ground.

Shrek: I used to be an ogre. Now I’m just a jolly green joke!

Fiona: Okay, okay, maybe you’re not the ogre you used to be, but maybe that’s not such a bad thing.

Shrek: I wouldn’t expect you to understand. It’s not like you’re a real ogre. You spent half your life in a palace.

Fiona: (solemnly) And the other half locked away in a tower.

Shrek: Look, all I want is for things to go back to the way they used to be! Back when villagers were afraid of me, and I could take a mud bath in peace. When I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to do it! Back when the world made sense!

Fiona: You mean back before you rescued me from the Dragon’s Keep?

Shrek: Exactly!

She looked at him, apalled by the answer, and a long silence followed, before Fiona spoke quietly, feeling hurt.

Fiona: Shrek, you have three beautiful children, a wife who loves you, friends who adore you. You have everything. Why is it the only person who can’t see that is you?

She then turned away and went to the door, looking back at her husband, who only gave a bitter look before she went back inside. Shrek just stood there before turning and walking away bitterly.

Shrek: That’s just great.

As he left, Rumpelstiltskin peeked out, and his pet goose, who was now freakishly larger than she was before, peeked out of another trash can, eating some trash. Rumpelstiltskin smirked evilly, knowing this was his chance to finally get back at the ogre who put him out of business.

Later, as rain clouds were appearing, Shrek was storming alone in the forest, stewing about what Fiona said.

Shrek: If she thinks I’m gonna slink back there and apologize, she’s got another thing coming. She’s not the boss of me. I’m an ogre and I’m not gonna apologize for acting like one.

He then heard a voice from the distance.

Voice: Help, please! Someone, anyone at all, help me! Please, help!

He headed over to see who it was, and in the middle of the forest, the cries of help (or so Shrek believes) came from Rumpelstiltskin, whose legs were underneath his carriage, making it appear as his carriage was broken down on top of him.

Rumpelstiltskin: Please, help! I’m stuck! Help! Oh, please, help! Someone, anyone! Help me! The pain!

Shrek rolled his eyes as he went over and used his strength to lift up the carriage.

Rumpelstiltskin: (squints eyes) I can see a bright light. A tunnel! Grandma? Is that you?

Shrek: (dryly) Yeah, it’s me, Granny.

Rumpelstiltskin: (pretend alarm) An ogre!

He scooched back underneath in "fright".

Rumpelstiltskin: Please, Mr. Ogre, please don’t eat me!

Shrek: I’m not gonna eat you.

Rumpelstiltskin: But you are an ogre…(peeks out) aren’t you?

Shrek: Yeah, well, I… I used to be. Look, move out or get crushed.

The short man quickly crawled away from the carriage. Shrek then put the carriage back down on the ground and fixed the wheel.

Rumpelstiltskin: So you’re not gonna eat me?

Shrek: (walks away) No, thanks. I already had a big bowl of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

The former deal maker followed the ogre.

Rumpelstiltskin: Wait up! What’s your rush? Where you going?

Shrek: Nowhere.

Rumpelstiltskin: (grins) What a coincidence! I was just heading that way myself. But, seriously, let me give you a ride. I insist. Come on. It’s the least I can do after all you’ve done for me.

The ogre sighed, rolling his eyes, but it seemed like he was giving in.

Rumpelstiltskin: I got a hot rat cooking.

Shrek glanced back at the carriage, with Fifi at the reigns, honking a bit. After Rumpelstiltskin managed to lead the ogre to his carriage, the two went inside with the short man throwing off his hat and going to his table to prepare a drink, shaking it up in his bottle.

Rumpelstiltskin: All right! Can I interest you in a mudslide? Slug and tonic? A liquid libation to ease that frustration?

He even made a fresh certain drink containing an eyeball.

Rumpelstiltskin: Eyeball-tini?

Shrek peered into the carriage and at the drink, unsure, but he was giving in again.

Shrek: Well, maybe just one.

A couple hours later, rain was pouring as Fifi was pulling the carriage through the forest. Inside, Shrek was telling a joke to Rumpelstiltskin, and the ogre has had more than just one Eyeball-tini.

Shrek: So the centaur says, "That’s not the half I’m talking about."

The two chuckled a bit.

Rumpelstiltskin: I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you. To live the life of an ogre…no worries, no responsibilities. (takes a sip of an eyeball-tini) You are free to pillage and terrorize as you please.

Shrek: Free? (chuckles and rolls eyes) That’s a laugh.

Rumpelstiltskin: Oh, yeah?

Shrek: Sometimes I wish I had just one day to feel like a real ogre again.

He ate the eyeball off the toothpick.

Rumpelstiltskin: Why didn’t you say so? (stands up in his chair) Magical transactions are my specialty! Come on!

He then grabbed all the empty glasses to put them away.

Shrek: Great. Next to mimes, magicians are my favourite people.

The short man laughed sarcastically while climbing a ladder.

Rumpelstiltskin: Hold on.

He started rummaging through his deal scrolls.

Rumpelstiltskin: "King for a Month." "Knight for a Week." (finds one) Ah.

He then laid out one special contract onto the table, titled "Ogre for a Day".

Rumpelstiltskin: "Ogre for a day".

The ogre was even more puzzled than ever. The short man then appeared right next to him.

Rumpelstiltskin: Think about it, Shrek. To be feared and hated. You’ll be, like, "Roar!" And the villagers will be, like, (mimicking scared citizen) "Get away! It’s Shrek! I’m so scared of him!" It would be just like the good old days, when your swamp was your castle. When the world made sense.

Shrek: All right, what’s the catch?

Rumpelstiltskin: Catch? No. There’s no catch. No catchings, really. I mean, there’s something. A small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

Shrek: All right, I knew it. So what do you want?

Rumpelstiltskin: A day.

Shrek: (doubtful) A day?

A little ding was heard.

Rumpelstiltskin: Oh, rat’s done!

He put on some oven mitts, opened the stove and took out the cooked rat.

Rumpelstiltskin: Well, to make the magic work, you gotta give something to get something. In this case, you gotta give a day to get a day. That’s all.

Shrek: I can’t just pick up and leave my family.

Rumpelstiltskin: Oh, but that’s the best part, Shrek! It’s a magical contract. No one will even know you’re gone, and by the time this day is up, (gives a smile) you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.

Shrek: Still, I don’t know.

Rumpelstiltskin: Pffft! Hey, no problem. Forget it, no big d. It doesn’t matter. Do you like white meat or dark meat?

The short man poured some sauce onto the rat with a soup ladel. Shrek looked thoughtful about this deal.

Shrek: So what day would I have to give up?

As Rumpelstiltskin got out a knife and fork, he smirked secretly.

Rumpelstiltskin: I don’t know, any day. A day from your past. (starts carving the rat) A day you had the flu? A day you lost a pet? (bitterly/faster) A day some meddling oaf stuckhisnosewhereitdidn'tbelong, DESTROYINGYOURBUSINESSANDRUINIGNGYOURLIFE?!

Of course, he was carving so fast that he ended up cutting through the rat and the plate, breaking it. Shrek looked at him a bit strangely but Rumpelstiltskin quickly realized his behavior as he hastily began to bring back his composure.

Rumpelstiltskin: Just for an example.

He placed the plate with the lower half of the rat on the table.

Shrek: How about the day I met Donkey? (smirks) Now, there’s a day I’d like to take back.

He laughed, and the short man forced a laugh.

Rumpelstiltskin: I don’t know who that is. (gets an idea) I know. What about a day you wouldn’t even remember? Like a day when you were a baby.

He began to rock his arms back and forth like rocking a baby to sleep, but figuratively.

Rumpelstiltskin: An innocent, mindless little baby.

Shrek, who was half-way done eating his half of the rat, spoke.

Shrek: You can take any of those days you want. Take them all, for all I care.

He chucked the rest of his half into his mouth, while Rumpelstiltskin glared.

Rumpelstiltskin: Oh, just one will do.

He then got out the ink jar and feather pen, dabbed the said pen into said jar, with a small magic spark appearing.

Rumpelstiltskin: OK, good. A day from your childhood it is.

Shrek: I guess there’s nothing wrong with wanting a little time for myself.

Rumpelstiltskin: Just 24 tiny little hours.

Shrek: I’m still my own ogre!

Rumpelstiltskin: Yeah, you is!

Shrek: I never needed to ask for anyone’s permission before.

Rumpelstiltskin: (pushes the contract towards him) So why start now?

Shrek looked down at the contract for a moment, and then looked back up at the deal maker, who handed the quill to the ogre.

Rumpelstiltskin: Go on, Shrek. Sign it!

As Shrek started signing his name in big, bold, gold letters, the deal maker kept urging him to sign it. He was so tensed from this, that even his nasty toes with yellow toenails ripped out of his shoes and scraped the floor.

Rumpelstiltskin: Go on, Shrek. Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

During the tension, Fifi also honked a few times, but then, when Shrek wrote the last letter of his name, the tension stopped. Fifi stopped honking and Rumpelstiltskin was calm, but had a glow of excitement.

Rumpelstiltskin: Oh. You signed it.

Shrek: So, tell me. What happens now?

Rumpelstiltskin: (mockingly) Have a nice day.

He then cackled villainously as he disappeared in a flash of yellow light. Then, to Shrek's shock, the pen disappeared and the whole carriage came apart like a house would in a tornado, and Shrek suddenly found himself caught in a glowing yellow cyclone, as the parts of the carriage disappeared. The ogre yelled in alarm as he was tossed all around through the air.

Shrek: Whoooaaa! WHOOOOAAAAAAAAAA!!

Then the yellow background transformed back into the forest setting, only it was sunny and during the daytime. Shrek came falling from the sky and crash-landed hard on the ground, with a jingling sound heard upon his crash.

Shrek: (groans) I think I fell on my keys.

Then the contract came floating gently down towards the ogre's feet. He picked it up, getting up, when suddenly, he heard a familiar voice.

Tour Guide's Voice: There are 40 children in that shoe, which is why the weasel goes pop to this very day.

He looked and saw the Star Tours chariot coming his way, to his dismay.

Shrek: Oh, great.

Tour Guide: As we head over the river and through the woods, we come across…

Of course, one tourist on the upper deck saw Shrek and did not give a reaction of happiness. In fact, it was one of alarm.

Tourist: (points) Ogre!!

The group, not recognizing Shrek, saw him and all reacted with horror, and suddenly the driver lost control as the horses were scared that they ran, resulting in the chariot to crash into a tree. The tour guide and tourists all ran off the wrecked chariot, screaming and heading for the hills. Shrek was a bit surprised at first but then he realized that the magic of the contract had worked, and people fear him once again. He grinned as he kissed the piece of paper, before laughing. The song "Top of the World" by the Carpenters began to play as Shrek left the forest and went on his way to the nearest village.

He strode merrily towards the unsuspecting villagers.

Such a feeling's coming over me

When the villagers all saw him, they all ran away in separate directions, screaming, while he continued striding with glee, glad to be feared again.

There is wonder in most everything that I see

We then see a puppet show with one puppet attacking an ogre puppet with a prop stick, with all the kids watching encouraging the puppet to beat the ogre.

Kids: Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!

Not a cloud in the sky

Then, without warning, the puppeteer, who turned out to be Shrek, rose his head up from the puppet theater's window and roared, making the kids scream. Then his arms burst through the cardboard, roaring again. The kids all ran away with Shrek walking up to the seats like a usual ogre would and then chuckled.

Got the sun in my eyes And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Somewhere else, a wedding was being held in a church. Inside, the priest gave the permission for the groom to kiss the bride.

Everything I want the world to be

The groom lifted the veil of his bride, who was actually Shrek (in drag), about to give a kiss. The groom and priest screamed in alarm. Then Shrek roared at everyone inside the church, making them all scream and leave the church.

Is now coming true, especially for me

Shrek, the only one left in the church, twirled around, holding the dress he was wearing.

And the reason is clear It's because you are near

Near a tree, a couple was about to have a picnic when Shrek, in normal garb, appeared hanging upside-down from a branch, roaring, scaring off the couple before he took the chicken leg and chomped it.

You're the nearest thing to heaven that I see

Next, we see Shrek scaring a cat, making it screech while jumping up. Then we see Shrek roaring at a mirror, breaking it. Shrek then got up behind four men gulping ale, letting out a roar, making them spit out their drinks. He then went to an old lady with a hearing horn.

Shrek: (speaks into hearing aid quietly) Roar.

The deaf old lady's eyes widened in alarm. Next, at a melon cart, someone was about to grab a melon, but grabbed Shrek's head, as the ogre was hiding in the melon cart and he gave yet another roar. Then he went near a goose, roaring at it, causing the goose to plop out an egg in fear.

I'm on the top of the world Lookin' down on creation And the only explanation I can find

We then see Shrek happily being chased by an angry mob like the old days, laughing. He then grabbed a hanging shop's sign, swung over the bar, removing the sign and leaping onto a roof, surfing over it like a surfboard and in the process, the surfing removed the shingles. He even surfed onto another roof, swung around a weather vane, hopped onto another roof and surfed down that one as well.

Is the love that I found Ever since you've been around

He leaped off the roof, with the villagers angrily tossing their pitchforks in the air like javelins, while Shrek soared relaxingly, with the pitchforks missing him.

Your love's put me at the top of the world

The ogre then landed in a hay cart, breaking off a wheel in the process. He then leaped out of the hay to declare something to the villagers.

Shrek: This is the part where you run away!

So the villagers all ran away in fear.

Is the love that I found Ever since you've been around

He then leaped off the cart like a diving board and splashed into a pigsty, startling some pigs upon the splash.

Your love's put me at the top of the world

He then lay back, doing a mud angel, laughing before sighing, glad to feel like an actual ogre once more.

Later, after Shrek got the mud cleaned off him, he went around the forest, and saw a Wanted poster for ogres and took it.

Shrek: Sure is great to be wanted again. (sees another poster) Oh, nice one.

Then when he saw one more wanted poster, and there was something different about the others that made his smile disappear. It had the face of a familiar ogre. He went up closer to it, and saw that it was of Fiona, giving a fierce look.

Shrek: Fiona?

He then saw more Wanted posters of Fiona on just about every tree, making him worried. He even saw a couple with axes and knives pinned at them. As he saw all the other posters, he began breathing harder.

Shrek: Oh, no.

He then raced out of the forest to get to his home. He raced through a cornfield, breathing like mad, and when he came to the end of it, he saw what looked like the structure of his swamp home, except there were no doors or windows.

Shrek: My home. (runs to it) Fiona!

However, the structure was very solid when he came up to it.

Shrek: Fiona! Are you in there?!

He then used his ogre strength to pound his way through the soil structure three times and soon created a hole which he fell in through. He got up and saw that the place was empty, and not only that but there was no furniture. It was all a dark underground setting with dirt and roots as far as the eye can see. He walked around, pushed through some dangling roots, and saw a rat on one root, before it and other rats scampered away. Shrek then frowned in anger before leaving the structure.

Shrek: (yelling out) All right, Rumpel! This wasn’t part of the deal!

He looked around and saw all the trees in his swamp all dry and leafless. Not only that, but there was no grass, plants or any swamp water. The place looked like a complete dried-up wasteland.

Shrek: Rumpel!

But not an answer came. Shrek then dug in his shirt and pulled out the folded-up contract that he unfolded, and thought to have a better look at it. Then something flew above him, making a 'woosh' sound. He thought it was nothing, but then there were two more quick figures flying above him. He then turned around and saw what appeared to be a pack of witches flying on their broomsticks. One witch, Broomsy Witch, spotted Shrek down below.

Broomsy: (points) Ogre!

Shrek gave a confused shrug. The other witches joined Broomsy.

Broomsy: We’ve got another one, ladies! Get him!

The witches all cackled as they dove in, flying in a circle around the swamp.

Shrek: Who are you?! What are you doing in my swamp?!

One laughing witch came swooping right at him, but he grabbed her broom, and she ended up yelling in alarm as she came crashing towards a tree. She got caught in the tree with her kicking feet sticking out.

Broomsy: Looks like a troublemaker!

She got out an apple, used her teeth to pluck out the stem like a grenade pin and chucked it towards Shrek's feet, to his confusion. Then the apple started spinning around like mad releasing smoke from it, and when smoke clouded the spot where Shrek was, he coughed as he tried waving the smoke away. Then one chain with an iron skull was swung and ensnared Shrek by the arm. The witches continued cackling as another witch tossed another chain with a chattering skull to ensnare Shrek by the ankle, and one more chain grabbed Shrek by the second ankle.

Broomsy: Spread ‘em!

Shrek yelped as he was pulled by the chains and lifted up in the air by the witches taking him away. He screamed as he was pulled up, and hit a part of what would have been the roof of his home along the way out. The witches cackled some more as they carried their prisoner off.

Broomsy: Nice job, ladies!

Shrek used his fist to break off the chain carrying his arm, forcing him to drop to the ground, but was still being dragged by the chains carrying his legs, grunting as he hit the ground before the witches managed to pull him back up in the air.

Shrek: You witches are making a big mistake! I know my rights!

Witch #2: You have the right to SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

The witch then threw a flaming pumpkin at him, and once it exploded upon hitting him, everything went black. Sometime later, Shrek was lying down asleep somewhere, as a familiar voice was heard singing outside.

Donkey's Voice: (singing) Just thinking about tomorrow Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow 'Til there's none

When I'm stuck with a day That's gray And lonely

Shrek: (groans) Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

His eyes opened up in realization.

Donkey's Voice: (singing) I just stick out my chin, And grin, And say

Shrek: Donkey!

He hit his head on the ceiling.

Shrek: Ow!

He then looked and found out he was in some sort of cage on wheels.

Donkey's Voice: (singing) Oh, the sun'll come out tomorrow So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow

He peeked and saw Donkey, fuzzier, pulling the carriage he was in.

Donkey: (singing) Come what may Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, Tomorrow!

Shrek: Donkey, where am I? What’s happening?

There were two witches on top of the cage in charge of driving.

Cage Witch #1: (hits Shrek with her broom) Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

She whipped Donkey, making him yelp as he sang a different song.

Donkey: (singing) But I made up my mind I'm keeping my baby Ooooh

Cage Witch #2: Yeah, I’m driving, so I’m in charge of the music.

She took the instrument of torture and gave the donkey another lash.

Donkey: Will you witches make up your mind?

The only response was another lash.

Donkey: (singing) No matter what they take from me

The second witch grinned, apparently liking the song as she nudged her partner, who also liked the song. They even started to sing along.

Donkey and Witches: (singing) They can't take away my dignity Because the greatest love of all

Shrek: Donkey? What’s going on? Do you know where Fiona is?

As the witches kept singing, Donkey quietly spoke to him.

Donkey: Quiet, ogre! You’re gonna get me in trouble and I need this job. I am not going back to work for Old MacDonald. Tell me to E-I-E-I-O. "E-I-E-I-No!" That’s what I said.

Shrek: Where are my babies? (as Donkey rolls his eyes) And where’s your wife, Dragon?

Donkey: Look, I think you have me confused with some other talking donkey. I’ve never seen you before in my life.

Shrek: (puzzled) Never seen me before? Come on, Donkey!

Donkey: And how do you know my name anyway?

Shrek: It’s me, Shrek. Your best friend?

Donkey: A donkey and an ogre friends? That’s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!

As Donkey kept pulling the cage, Shrek fumed in frustration.

Shrek: Can you at least tell me where they’re taking me?

Donkey: To the same place they take every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

Shrek: Stiltskin!

Witch #1: (hits Shrek with her broom) I said "quiet"!

The second witch whipped Donkey again.

Donkey: (singing) Hit me with your best shot

She gave him another lash.

Donkey: (singing) Why don't you hit me with your best shot

She gave him another lash, as if taking the lyrics literally.

Donkey: (singing) Hit me with your best shot

Shrek then pounded the cage angrily as he saw something definitely different, and to his horror, it was most of the letters of the Far, Far Away sign destroyed.

Shrek: Oh, no.

Donkey: (singing) Fire away!

To make matters worse, the green hills of the kingdom were now like a barren wasteland, and the castle is replaced with a huge fortress of a castle with a familiar carriage at the top, with a big 'R' on top as well.

As Donkey pulled the cage through the village, Shrek looked on in disgust at how different Far, Far Away was in this alternate universe. The villagers were all scrounging for something or living miserably.

Muffin Man's Voice: It’s time to crumble! Place your bets! Place your bets!

Shrek turned, seeing a small crowd gathered around a small makeshift arena, placing bets, with the Muffin Man holding a spatula with a certain gingerbread man.

Muffin Man: We start tout de suite!

Gingy sprung up, but now he had battle scars on his face, chest, and arms, and was decorated with battle gear and a kilt like a Braveheart character, and he held up a big lollipop as his weapon.

Gingy: Yeah!

He gave a battle cry, leaping down onto the small arena while breaking his lollipop to give it sharp edges.

Shrek: (confused) Gingy?

Then out of three boxes came an assortment of sentient animal crackers charging at the gingerbread man, but because he now had a fierce personality, he shouted as he dodged each animal and used his lollipop to take down his opponents. He even used it to turn and decapitate some of the animal crackers.

Gingy: Gingy snap!

The spectators laughed, enjoying this sport. One of the certain dwarfs, who was one of the spectators, saw the cage pulling Shrek.

Dwarf: (points at it) There’s one! Disgusting, filthy ogre!

All the villagers gathered around with nasty scowls, shouting and jeering at the ogre prisoner.

Villagers: (randomly) Hideous monster! Filthy, filthy creature! Disgusting creature!

One villager chucked an overripe tomato at Shrek's face, with Shrek wiping it off. The villagers continued shouting nasty remarks towards Shrek as the cage pulled onward. One villager even chucked a glass bottle at the cage.

The witches, Shrek and Donkey soon made it to the castle, which was now guarded by witches about every nook and cranny, and there was a shield with an "R" on the front of the gates, which went up. As they went inside, Shrek was in horror to see how different the castle grounds looked, and he passed something he definitely hadn't seen before: two ogres pushing the gear that controls the gates. The two ogres were miserable because they were being forced to by another witch with a whip.

Slavery Witch: Move it!

She whipped one of the ogres as she cackled evilly.

The gate then closed as the carriage headed to the main hall and stopped right at the door. Once there, the cage's door was opened, Shrek was let out but placed in hand-cuffs and shackles around his neck, which were connected to sticks held by four more witches, as they lead the prisoner to the doors.

Shrek: (quietly) Don’t worry, Donkey. I’ll get us our lives back.

Donkey: Yeah, right. Put a little mustard on mine, Captain Crazy!

The witches laughed heartlessly while pushing the doors open, and inside the huge room was a rave party going on with the whole room infested with witches, dancing and celebrating, with loud rave music playing. They saw the witches leading the imprisoned ogre through the room as they moved aside. Shrek glanced at his surroundings, and saw the Three Little Pigs in servant clothes feeding Fifi some ham. She pecked at it a bit, before scarfing it all down. He glanced at another corner with a witch band playing the rave music with a pumpkin drum, a broomstick bass, a skull xylophone which made synthisizer music, and a huge brewing cauldron. As the rest of the witches continued dancing and shouting with glee, the witches that held Shrek prisoner kept leading Shrek across the ballroom. At this time, at a small corner lined with red VIP ropes in front, a certain deal maker was in a couch-styled throne (with the ruler's seat being in the middle), wearing fancy white clothes, laughing and having drinks with four more witches. Then another witch called out.

Witch: Mr. Stiltskin? You got another customer.

He took a sip from a cocktail drink, glancing at the customer with a wide smirk. The customer was Pinocchio, who was being ushered through the VIP line by the witch. He turned to Wolf, now dressed as a maid, next to a cart full of different wigs.

Rumpelstiltskin: (snaps fingers) Wolfie!

Wolf: (dryly) Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.

Rumpelstiltskin: Bring me my business wig.

Pinocchio: (pleading) Mr. Stiltskin, please!

Rumpelstiltskin: (cutting him off) Abupupup!

The miserable wolf placed a Victorian styled white powdered wig over the short man.

Rumpelstiltskin: (signals) OK, go.

Pinocchio: Please make me a real boy!

Rumpelstiltskin got out a rolled up contract and smacked the wolf away.

Rumpelstiltskin: Go away! (to Pinocchio) Terms are in the details, balsa boy.

He rolled out the contract, and pushed it, a quill and an ink jar towards the puppet, who was eagerly ready to sign.

Pinocchio: Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!

The short man laughed as the puppet started signing.

Shrek: (yells out) Stiltskin!

Then all the music, dancing and talking stopped as all the witches turned towards the ogre. The deal maker was excited as he stood up on his desk.

Rumpelstiltskin: Shrek! There he is!

As he walked across the desk, he unknowingly knocked over the ink jar, spilling ink over the spot where Pinocchio signed half his name in cursive.

Pinocchio: So close!

The puppet's arm was grabbed by one of the witches and dragged away from the table, without Rumpelstiltskin caring to notice.

Rumpelstiltskin: (extending out his arms) Have I been waiting for you!

He hopped from the table and announced to all the witches.

Rumpelstiltskin: Ladies, this is the guy that made all of this possible!

They all cheered wildly. Then the deal maker climbed up towards Shrek's ear, pulling on it and speaking into it.

Rumpelstiltskin: So, tell me, how are you enjoying your day?

Shrek: All right, Rumpel, what’s going on? What have you done?

He hopped off.

Rumpelstiltskin: No, Shrek, it’s not what I’ve done. It’s what you’ve done. (skips to his table and sits on it) Thanks to you, the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to me.

Shrek: (rolls eyes) They would never do that.

Rumpelstiltskin: They would if I promised them all their problems would disappear.

(Flashback)

We see the same moment of Fiona's parents visiting the deal maker to sign a contract to save their daughter, but this time, it has a different ending. They signed their names, and then suddenly the king and queen began turning gold, to their alarm and horror.

Rumpelstiltskin's Voice: And then THEY disappeared!

Queen Lillian: No!

King Harold: No!

They then started to fade away.

Both: Noooooooo!

The king and queen exploded into gold dust, leaving only their crowns which dropped onto the table. The evil deal maker then took Harold's crown.

(End of Flashback)

Rumpelstiltskin held out the deceased king's crown, as Shrek realized he had tricked the king and queen into signing the kingdom and their lives over. Rumpelstiltskin spun the crown around as he sighed.

Rumpelstiltskin: They would have done anything if they thought it would end their daughter’s curse.

Shrek: I ended Fiona’s curse!

Rumpelstiltskin: How could you when you never existed?

He kicked the crown away.

Shrek: You better start making sense, you dirty little man!

Rumpelstiltskin: (pulls out contract from Shrek's vest) Here, let me spell it out for you! (points to fine print) You gave me a day from your past, a day you couldn’t even remember. A day when you were an innocent, mindless little baby.

He walked away, mockingly humming "Happy Birthday", and that's when it dawned on Shrek.

Shrek: You took the day I was born.

The dictator held his toes before spreading his legs out.

Rumpelstiltskin: No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

Shrek: Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin, because when this day is up…

Rumpelstiltskin: (interrupts) But you haven’t heard the best part.

He snapped his fingers, and another witch brought over a huge magic hourglass to the table, rerpesenting the remaining hours of the day.

Rumpelstiltskin: Since you were never born, once this day comes to an end, so will you.

The witches all laughed as Shrek saw the hourglass with the sand running, which meant the time he had left was running.

Shrek: Where’s Fiona? Where’s my family?

Rumpelstiltskin: Silly little ogre. You don’t get it, do you? You see, you were never born. You never met Fiona. (menacingly) Your kids don’t exist.

Then the witches all laughed at Shrek's misery, making the ogre more upset. Rumpelstiltskin even taunted him some more.

Rumpelstiltskin: How’s that for a metaphysical paradox? Looks like you got exactly what you wanted! (mockingly) Happy Ogre Day!

Shrek finally snapped and went for the short man.

Shrek: (furiously) Rumpel!!

He lunged at Rumpelstiltskin, who yelped in alarm as he jumped back.

Rumpelstiltskin: Get him, witches!

A witch fired another skull chain at Shrek, but he sensed it was coming this time, so he turned and blocked himself with the chains of his cuffs, just in time for the skull to reach him. The skull chomped the chains, breaking them. The witches screamed in alarm and panic as Shrek then ripped the shackles off his neck, growling. Another witch flying on a broomstick was twirling a skull chain and firing it at Shrek, but he quickly grabbed it and gave it a yank, pulling the witch down to his level. Shrek and the witch were face-to-face, with the witch worried what he would do to her.

Outside in the halls, Donkey was speaking to two witches, though it was hard to tell if they were paying attention or ignoring.

Donkey: You know what’d help morale around here? Flip-flop Fridays. Feet would be comfortable with the breeze on your toes.

Then, without warning, the doors burst open and Shrek came flying through on the broomstick he took, rather clumsily. He knocked the two witches and Donkey down in the process, and at this time, "Click Click" by Light FM started playing. Shrek yelped a bit as he rode a loop-de-loop. Donkey looked over the edge of the bridge he was on and saw Shrek spiraling downward before trying to ride the broom on the bottom story, though not doing very well.

Witch: Come on, girls!

Five of the witches leaped off the bridge and onto their broomsticks, cackling madly as they pursued the ogre throughout the floor. Through the halls, Shrek still tried getting the hang of flying a broom as the pumpkin witch chucked pumpkin bombs at him, but he luckily dodged each one. Back on the top story, Rumpelstiltskin came out, angrily shoving one of the witches.

Rumpelstiltskin: Lock all the doors, you worthless witches! (kicks a witch) Do it!

The short man then saw Shrek flying up towards him with a stern look, making him yelp. As the ogre on the broom zoomed upward, Rumpelstiltskin's wig briefly flew off his head from the impact.

Shrek: (calls back) I’ll be right back, Donkey!

He zoomed off, trying to figure out how to shake the witches.

Donkey: I don’t know you.

He then looked back at Rumpelstiltskin.

Donkey: I don’t know him.

The witches pursued Shrek through a higher story, and when he came to the edge and saw a pole, he smirked, getting an idea. Once he came to the pole, he swung around it and flew back, though rather lop-sided. When the witches saw him swerving towards them, they all flew out of the way to avoid getting hit. Shrek then managed to get a decent hold of the broom as he zoomed back to the bottom floor, dodging more incoming pumpkin bombs. He came back to the floor where Rumpelstiltskin and Donkey were, stopped the broom and glared at the foe.

Donkey: I’m glad I’m not you.

The dictator ran off as Shrek then swooped in, but instead of going after the deal maker who stole his birth, he scooped up Donkey in one swipe and flew into another room, with Donkey screaming for help.

Donkey: Help me! Help!

Shrek saw the skylight up above, and he smirked, getting an escape idea.

Donkey: Oh, no! Help!

With the witches still on the ogre's tail, he swung around the golden chain of a huge shiny ball hung as the castle's centerpiece. He grabbed the chain, and began to twirl around the room while holding the chain, using the ball to smash everything in its path, with the witches (the ones who weren't chasing Shrek) all screaming as they ran to avoid getting crushed by the ball or the debris. While this happened, Rumpelstiltskin could only watch helplessly and in despair.

Rumpelstiltskin: No, not my pretty ball!

The witches continued pursuing Shrek, with the ogre and donkey getting closer to the skylight, with Donkey screaming and Shrek yelling.

Shrek: (covers Donkey's eyes) Watch out!

The two then smashed straight through the skylight with the ball getting jammed in the hole, and the flying witches' brooms getting pinned to the ball itself, and some fell off, screaming, and landed on the floor. Outside, Shrek and Donkey zoomed off and away from the castle, with Donkey still screaming. Back in the castle, the ball didn't have anything to latch itself to, so it didn't take long for the ball itself to creak loudly, before falling back and crashing into the ground with a very loud thump.

Rumpelstiltskin: Wolfie? My angry wig.

The witch maids walked away in worry while Wolf removed the business wig and replaced it with a new one, which was a tall, red, fiery wig that resembled either Syndrome's hair from the Incredibles or a Troll doll's hair. Wolf walked away as well before the dictator breathed in anger.

With Shrek and Donkey, the two continued riding the broom, with the latter still panicking and struggling to get out of the ogre's grip.

Donkey: Help! I’ve been kidnapped by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

Shrek: Donkey! Get off of me! Watch it with your pointy hooves!

Then they ended up crashing through a tree, and it looked like Donkey was riding the broom with Shrek holding onto the edge. Then, as they crashed through another tree, and it looked like Shrek was riding the broom backwards with Donkey riding on the bottom, upside-down. Then, after crashing through another tree, the two ended up flying off the broomstick and on the ground hard, with Shrek on his back and Donkey on the ogre's stomach. Donkey then looked very worried, and then, the next thing you know, he was running for his life with the ogre chasing after him.

Donkey: Just take my wallet, just take my wallet!

Shrek: (running to Donkey) Hey!

Donkey: I’m being **s-napped!!

Shrek then tackled his best friend, who was still terrified of the ogre.

Donkey: Animal cruelty! Help!

Shrek: (covers Donkey's mouth) You need to calm down! I’m your friend.

Donkey: (muffled) My friend?

Shrek: I’m not gonna hurt you, all right?

He nodded, though in fear.

Shrek: Good. I’m gonna let go…right…now.

Once Shrek removed his hand, Donkey still panicked.

Donkey: Please! Eat my face last! Send my hooves to my mama!

Shrek: Donkey! You’ve got to trust me.

Donkey: Why should I trust you?

Shrek: Because…because…

He then thought of the only way to convince Donkey, but he shook his head, not believing he was about to do it.

Shrek: (sighs) OK.

He got up and started to sing while dancing a bit, and wasn't particularly good at carrying a tune.

Shrek: (singing) Winter, spring, summer, fall All you got to do is call And I'll be there, ye, ye, ye You've got a friend

Donkey then got up, with his look of fear fading away, and he began to grin warmly. It looked like for a minute, Donkey recognized his best friend and was about to embrace him but instead, he ran away, screaming some more. The ogre was left dumbstruck.

Shrek: Fine! Go ahead! Run away! Who needs you?

He then miserably walked through the forest and sat down on a log, but upon sitting, a squeaky noise was heard. He reached from his pocket and pulled out the source of the noise, Felicia's squeaky ogre toy. He stared at it and held it sadly, knowing he'll never see Fiona or his kids again. Then, as a tear began streaming from his eye, he held his head down.

Donkey's Voice: I’ve never seen an ogre cry.

He turned and saw Donkey right next to him. He then wiped the tear away.

Shrek: I’m not crying.

Donkey: It’s nothing to be ashamed of. I cry all the time. Just thinking about my grandma, or thinking about baby kittens, or my grandma kissing a baby kitten, (choking up) or a little baby grandma kitten. (starts to cry himself) That is so darn sad.

Shrek: I said I’m not crying!

Donkey: (recovers) Take it easy, I’m only trying to help. It’s none of my business why you’re upset. By the way, why are you upset?

Shrek: I was tricked into signing something I shouldn’t have.

Donkey: You signed up for one of them time-shares, huh?

Shrek: (pulls out contract) No. I signed this.

Donkey: (gasps) You should never sign a contract with Rumpelstiltskin!

Shrek: Yeah, I got that.

Donkey: His fine print is crafty.

Shrek: I know.

Donkey: His exit clauses are sneaky.

Shrek: Yeah, I...What did you say?

Donkey: I’m talking about the exit clause. Used to be, you had to guess his name, but now everybody knows who Rumpelstiltskin is.

Shrek: Donkey, I’ve read the fine print. There’s nothing about an exit clause in here.

Donkey: Well, you didn’t expect him to make it easy for you. Here, let me show you how it’s done.

He grabbed the contract with his teeth and placed it on the ground, starting to fold the paper.

Donkey: I didn’t spend all that time around them witches without picking up a few tricks. Your tiny, little ogre brain couldn’t begin to comprehend the complexity of my polygonic foldability skills.

Shrek: What are you doing?

Donkey: Hey, I can’t get my origami on unless you back off. Thank you.

Shrek rolled his eyes and sighed as Donkey continued folding.

Shrek: OK, here’s what you gotta do. You fold this piece here, make this letter match up here, bring this corner here, and if you do it just right, it will show you what to do.

Then Shrek saw that Donkey's paper folding started to from letters together to form the exit clause. Once Donkey was finished, he showed the folded up paper to the ogre.

Donkey: There! "Try Lou’s Bliss. "

Shrek only gave a confused look.

Donkey: Now, who’s Lou?

Shrek: Give me that!

He snatched the paper and did some folding himself, and then it showed a heart with the TRUE words of the exit clause: "True Love's Kiss".

Shrek: "True Love’s Kiss. "

Donkey: Hey, you have to take me to dinner first.

Shrek: (rolls eyes) "According to fairy tale law, if not fully satisfied, true love’s kiss will render this contract null and void." Donkey, you did it!

He then picked Donkey up and hugged him, with Donkey struggling.

Shrek: Look at you! If Fiona and I share true love’s kiss, I will get my life back!

Donkey: (gets down) OK! This isn’t a petting zoo! So where is this Fiona?

Shrek: Well, that’s just it, you see. I don’t know.

Donkey: You know, when I lose something, I always try to retrace my steps. So, where did you leave her last?

Shrek: The last time I saw her, I told her I wished I’d never rescued her.

His eyes widened in realization.

Shrek: Oh, no.

Shrek knew the only place to look was the place he first rescued her: the dragon's keep, and that's where he went, with Donkey following. This time, there was no lava surrounding the castle. Shrek ran across the bridge, hoping to find Fiona.

Donkey: Shrek? Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek! What, are you crazy? That’s the Dragon’s Keep! They keep dragons in there!

He tried running across to stop the ogre, but he screamed when one of the boards he stepped on broke, so he quickly went back.

Donkey: OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead! I’m gonna just hang back here and find us some breakfast!

Not paying attention to Donkey, Shrek just raced through the castle, breathing desperately. Thankfully, since Dragon wasn't there either for some reason, Shrek had no trouble making it to the stairs leading to the highest room in the tallest tower. He ran up those stairs and burst the door open, causing pigeons in the room to scatter.

Shrek: Fiona!

He looked and saw the bed where he first found Fiona deserted, and the curtains and sheets were all ripped. That's not all he saw. He saw something behind the tapestry of a knight on a steed. He went over, pushing the tapestry aside, seeing markings on the stone wall. They were tallies of all the days Fiona has been locked in the tower. Shrek tore the tapestry off, and the whole wall was marked with tallies. Shrek put his hand on the wall in regret, and then depressingly went over to the bed, and there he saw Fiona's princess tiara.

Shrek: Oh, no.

He picked up the tiara, sat down and held it in his hands.

Shrek: If I didn’t save Fiona…then who did?

He then noticed another object on the ground, and that object was the handkerchief Fiona gave Shrek on the day he rescued her. He picked it up and held it as well.

Soon, he returned from the castle, holding the handkerchief.

Shrek: This is the favour Fiona was supposed to give me on the day we met.

Donkey looked surprised.

Shrek: It’s a symbol of our love. (pushes hankie in front of Donkey's face) Now smell it!

Donkey: (winces) Hey, man, get that dirty favour out of my face!

Shrek: Your nose is the only chance I have of tracking down my wife, so stop complaining and start smelling. (waves it in front of Donkey) Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

Donkey: Do I look like a bloodhound to you? In case you haven’t noticed, I’m a donkey, not a dog! If I was a dog, they’d call me Dog, not Donkey! And another thing...

Then he started sniffing.

Donkey: Wait a minute. I think I got something.

He sniffed the air some more, walking around a bit.

Donkey: Whatever it is, it’s sweet.

Shrek: Fiona.

Donkey: Luscious and tasty.

Shrek: (frowns) Hey! That’s my wife you’re talking about.

The donkey then abruptly rose his head up, and dashed off into the forest.

Shrek: Donkey!

Donkey started sniffing the ground in the forest like a bloodhound, and to his surprise and happiness, he saw an unguarded plate of stacked waffles coated in syrup sitting on a stump.

Donkey: Yeah! Waffles! And I thought the Waffle Fairy was just a bedtime story. (rushes up to plate) Sticky stacks of golden, syrupy deliciousness!

Shrek: Donkey! Don’t eat that!

Donkey stopped and frowned.

Shrek: There’s a stack of freshly made waffles in the middle of the forest. Don’t you find that a wee bit suspicious?

Donkey only gave an "I don't know" kind of mumble before trying to take a little nibble of the waffles, but Shrek kept protesting against it.

Shrek: Oh, you…(as Donkey prepares to nibble) I’m just…What are you…? Bad Donkey! Mustn’t--I said, don’t! Don’t! No! Get away from it.

But Donkey extended his tongue out and licked the dripping syrup of the waffles.

Shrek: You did.

Then, without warning, the plate flung the waffles onto a tree. Donkey quickly realized it was a trap.

Donkey: Uh-oh.

The stump flipped open like a lid and looked at the hole, rather confused because it didn't seem like an effective trap to him. However, that was not the full trap. Shrek glanced around, seeing hidden pulleys and counterweights turning, and then a log came swinging out to the direction of the two.

Shrek: (ducks) Look out!

But Donkey didn't duck in time, as he got hit in the end by the log, sending him into the hole. The ogre ran up to the hole, lifting the lid, seeing Donkey lying there.

Shrek: Donkey! Are you OK?

Donkey: I’m fine.

But then his hooves got snagged by a rope trap and he was yanked away, screaming.

Shrek: Donkey.

He leaped into the hole and saw it led to a tunnel, and because it was small to walk through, he had to crawl through it.

Donkey's Voice: Help! Help me! Help, Shrek! Help!

Then he came out through the other end, pushing the roots, and when getting up, he was awestruck at where he was. He was in some hidden camp with ogres like him roaming about, carrying stuff and doing chores. He wandered around in amazement, looking at the sights, making him grin a bit. A blacksmith ogre was sharpening a tool and a female ogre was carrying an anvil of some sort. As Shrek kept wandering, two ogres carrying a log were coming from behind him.

Ogre #1: Watch your head.

He then ducked, letting the two ogres lift the log over him. Then three ogres, including a female one named Gretched, came around him.

Ogre #2: Hey, it’s a new guy!

Ogre #3: Look at him, all dressed up in his Sunday vest.

Gretched: He’s really tiny, isn’t he?

Ogre #2: Yeah.

Then, a slender ogre taller than Shrek, known as Brogan, came behind our main ogre, putting his arm around him.

Brogan: Fate has delivered us a comrade-in-arms and for that, we are thankful. Suit him up!

The other ogres then took Shrek to get suited up.

Ogre #3: Let’s go, greenie.

Shrek: Now, wait a minute!

He was placed on an armor vest, along with some wrist bands, and a helmet. One ogre smacked him in the rear to get him going.

Shrek: Hey!

Brogan: Here you go.

An axe was tossed into Shrek's arms, which Shrek luckily caught. Three ogres each threw an axe at three different dummies wearing witch's clothes. One ogre even tackled a witch dummy, and brawled with it. Shrek

Brogan: Welcome to the resistance.

Shrek: (confused) Resistance?

Brogan: (puts arm around Shrek) We fight for freedom and ogres everywhere!

He then held his nose and started blowing a toot through his ears, and then, all the other ogres held their noses and blew through their ears. When the blowing was done, the resistance ogres hooted and laughed while Shrek was even more stunned than already.

Shrek: I didn’t know we could do that.

Suddenly, he heard a certain donkey yelling for help, and he turned to see Donkey being carried upside-down by two ogres and tied to some sticks.

Donkey: Help! You can’t eat me! I got the mange! I’m poisonous! I’m all poi…

But one of the ogres stuffed an apple in his mouth, resulting in Donkey to yell, muffled. Then Shrek grabbed Donkey by the sticks.

Shrek: I’ll take him! This order’s to go.

One of the ogres carrying him, a chef ogre named Cookie then grabbed the sticks.

Cookie: Hey! I haven’t removed his giblets yet.

Shrek: Trust me, you don’t want to eat this one.

Donkey: (spits out apple) I go down smooth, but come out fighting!

The two ogres ended up having a tug-of-war with Donkey.

Shrek: Let go!

Cookie: Don’t make Papa mad.

Shrek: Your dinner is my friend!

Brogan came over, trying to break up the two.

Brogan: Come on, guys!

Cookie: I got to get the giblets out!

Then, a horn was sounded, stopping the fight and getting all ogres' and Donkey's attention.

Ogre #4: She’s back.

Shrek turned and saw a figure arriving on the hill, who was clad with a helmet and armor, and holding an axe in her hand. She removed her helmet, and revealed to be none other than Fiona (in ogre form). She stood there, with the wind blowing her hair, giving it a dramatic flare. When Shrek saw her, he grinned in so much relief.

Shrek: There she is. (hands axe to one of the ogres) Fiona!

He began running up to Fiona, who noticed Shrek running up to her.

Shrek: I’m so happy I found you!

Of course, because Shrek was never born, Fiona did not accept/return the embrace. Instead, before Shrek could hug her, he lifted up her foot and kicked Shrek in the face, sending him flying, yelling in slow-motion, before crashing to the ground. The ogres winced while some couldn't help but chuckle a bit. The groaning Shrek got up as Fiona walked up, handing her axe to Gretched, and her helmet to Brogan.

Fiona: Maybe you missed orientation, but for future reference, personal space is very important to me.

Shrek then looked very worried.

Shrek: You don’t know who I am, do you?

Fiona: No. (to Brogan) Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away. Gather the others and meet me in the war room.

Shrek: Fiona.

Fiona: Gretched, make sure everyone is prepared to move out tonight.

Shrek: I need to talk to you.

Fiona: What is it?

Shrek: OK, I know you don’t remember me, but…we’re married.

Needless to say, she gave a confused look.

Shrek: Hear me out. I was at the birthday party with some pigs and a puppet, the villagers wanted me to sign their pitchforks, and this boy kept saying, "Do the roar. Do the roar. Do the roar."

As he explained and tried making it sound as believable as he could, Brogan and Gretched were equally as confused as Fiona.

Shrek: Then I punched the cakes that the pigs ate and the next thing I knew, my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

Needless to say as well, pretty much all ogres that weren't Shrek, were completely dumbstruck, and so was Donkey.

Shrek: Right? Who’s with me?

Fiona: Wow, (chuckles a bit) I guess I must have kicked him harder than I thought.

The ogres in the resistance laughed a bit.

Shrek: Fiona, I need to…

But she held his hand up, as a lookout ogre was perched on a lookout, making "caw" sounds.

Fiona: Witches! All right, everyone, you know the drill!

She and the other ogres (except Shrek) went to their battle stations.

Shrek: Fiona!

Donkey: Witches! Oh, no! Witches! Witches!

Shrek grabbed Donkey and the sticks he was still attached to.

Shrek: Come on, now.

Some of the ogres cut some ropes, closing up the big holes some ogres hid in just in time, and dropping sand bags on fires, putting them out. The weapons were placed in a net which was hoisted upwards, and then a couple ogres hid in a hole underground, putting a cover over the hiding place. Some other ogres, wearing rocks and plants on their heads, held their breaths as they ducked down into some swamp water, and the remaining ogres (Fiona and Brogan included) with bush disguises gathered around the spot where Shrek was and crouched down. With that, every last ogre and the camp itself was completely hidden from sight. Shrek covered the whimpering Donkey's mouth, while the ogres looked up, and saw three of the witches flying up over the forest on their brooms. The lead witch glanced down at the forest, not finding any ogres or the camp, and gave a sneer. The witches then flew off, retreating to Rumpelstiltskin's castle. Once they were gone, the ogres came from their hiding place, murmuring while heading back to their posts.

Brogan: Fiona, that’s the third patrol today. We can’t hide forever.

Fiona: Trust me, Brogan. After tonight, we won’t have to.

Shrek and Donkey just sat where they were.

Donkey: That’s your wife?

Shrek: That’s my wife.

Donkey: Well, I see who wears the chain mail in your family!

The ogre gave a weird look at the donkey.

Back at Rumpelstiltskin's palace, the dictator, not wearing any wigs, was staring at the hour glass with the sands of Shrek's time running, and he gave a sigh.

Rumpelstiltskin: Some people like to look at the goblet as--as half empty.

He then turned to a table where some of his witches was sitting, and each had her own cupcake.

Rumpelstiltskin: Me, I like to look at it as half full. We’ve gone from the bottom to the top, ladies, but we’re not just an empire, we’re a family. Everyone has got their cupcake? Cupcake? Cupcake? Good. Yes? (to one of the witches) Baba?

The witch named Baba nodded.

Rumpelstiltskin: Good.

He then walked around the table as he continued.

Rumpelstiltskin: Yeah, you know, we have put away a lot of ogres. And so one got away. Who cares? It’s not a big deal. It doesn’t matter to me.

One of the witches who was eating her cupcake, nodded in agreement.

Rumpelstiltskin: It’s not like it’s the end of the world.

Then he came to the edge of the table, with the tone of his voice becoming a bit more sharp.

Rumpelstiltskin: Except, funny thing...

He motioned the witch he was near to help him upon top of the table and that's what she did, and the villain began to rant.

Rumpelstiltskin: Now that I think about it, the ogre who got away is Shrek! (with frustration raising in his voice) And if he shares a kiss with Fiona by sunrise, it IS the end of the world! OUR world! MY EMPIRE!!

Fifi, resting nearby, honked loudly. Then Rumpelstiltskin exhaled, calming down a bit, as he continued speaking more calmly, though his voice still had a hint of danger to it.

Rumpelstiltskin: But, as I was saying, (takes pitcher of water and pours it into glass) I like to look at the goblet as half full.

The witches gasped and whimpered in fear, knowing that he might use it to melt any one of them.

Rumpelstiltskin: Yelling makes me so parched. Would anyone care for some water?

He began to walk across the table and shove the glass of water in one of the panicked witches' faces.

Rumpelstiltskin: Wet your whistle?

She shook her head 'no' in fear as he slyly walked over to another panicked witch.

Rumpelstiltskin: A clear, crisp, delicious glass...of aqua purificada?

She nervously declined as well.

Rumpelstiltskin: Anybody’s thirsty? Nobody’s thirsty? No? (puts pitcher down) Well, then does anyone care to tell me what it’s going to take to get this ogre?!

He narrowed his eyes and pointed to Broomsy Witch.

Rumpelstiltskin: You.

Broomsy Witch: Faster brooms?

Rumpelstiltskin: No!

Hat Witch: (scared) Pointier hats?

Rumpelstiltskin: No! (to another witch) You!

Witch: Maybe we could hire a professional bounty hunter?

He shouted and stomped his feet in frustration before splashing the water onto the witch, melting her like a certain other witch.

Witch: (as she's melting) What a world! What a world!

Soon, as the steam cleared and there was nothing left of that witch but a soggy pile of her clothes. Then, Rumpelstiltskin pondered at the suggestion.

Rumpelstiltskin: You know, actually not a bad idea. (points to Baba) Baba!

Baba jumped out of her chair in fear.

Rumpelstiltskin: I need a bounty hunter. And if music doth soothe the savage beast…(chortles evilly a bit) then I think I might know just the person!

He dipped his finger in the frosting of the cupcake and licked the frosting right off, giving a malicious grin.

Back at the resistance camp, a meeting was being held inside a tree, with Shrek and Donkey, who was untied, looking from the outside through some holes in the trees. Shrek has gathered Brogan, Gretched, Cookie, and some other ogres to discuss a battle plan, which was set out on a rock table, with little model figures and everything.

Fiona: Listen up, everyone. Word has come from Far Far Away. Stiltskin is leading tonight’s ogre hunt himself.

The ogres started murmuring.

Ogres: (randomly) He’s never done that before. What? Why?

Donkey: I bet that’s because of us.

Shrek: Shhh!

Brogan: If that cupcake-eating clown finally leaves the safety of his filthy witch nest, he’ll be vulnerable.

Fiona: The plan’s simple.

She starts moving a model of the carriage with a couple witches along a path, with the ogre models off to the side and Fiona's model on top of a cliff.

Fiona: If they follow the usual patrol route, they’ll reach the river by midnight. We’ll be concealed along this road, waiting for his caravan. Once they reach the clearing, I’ll give the signal.

Fiona pressed the top of her model's head, making its arm raise up a sword it had, which would be the signal.

Fiona: And then we attack!

He raised her actual dagger and used it to slide the ogre models toward the witch models, knocking the latter down and off the table.

Fiona: And when the smoke clears…

Then she noticed a model of Cookie with some sort of wagon.

Fiona: Wait, what’s this?

Cookie: That’s my chimichanga stand.

Fiona: No, Cookie. We won’t be needing that.

Cookie: Trust me, Fiona. Y’all gonna be really hungry after this ambush, okay?

She only gave a small smirk, deciding to humor him.

Cookie: Go ahead and finish your little speech.

Fiona: All right, as I was saying, when the smoke clears, Rumpelstiltskin is gone and the chimichangas have been eaten. Far Far Away will finally be free.

Brogan: And so will we.

Fiona: Spread the word. We move out as soon as Rumpel leaves the palace.

The other ogres chattered in agreement, while outside, Shrek and Donkey looked concerned.

Donkey: Man, this is serious!

Shrek: (slumps back) Tell me about it. How am I ever gonna get her to kiss me before sunrise?

Donkey: Actually, I was talking about the revolution.

Shrek: Revolution?

He only gave a scoff.

Donkey: Why don’t you just tell her what you told me? About how you’re her true love and you came from an alternate universe.

Shrek: (sarcastically) Well, while I’m at it, why don’t I tell her that you’re married to a fire-breathing dragon and you have little, mutant donkey-dragon babies.

Hearing this made the Donkey stunned and interested a bit.

Donkey: I do?!

Shrek: You saw what happened. She’s gonna think I’m crazy.

Donkey: I’m a daddy?

He then glanced at a frog nearby, getting a new idea.

Shrek: You know what? If I got Fiona to kiss me once…

He then blew the frog up like a balloon exactly like he did before.

Shrek: Then I can do it again.

Shrek started to head inside Fiona's tent. He peered his head inside.

Donkey: Shrek, do my babies have hooves or talons?

Shrek: Donkey! Hello? Fiona?

He went inside with the frog balloon tied to a string attached to a small gift basket he had. He looked around, seeing a shield and weapons hung up, and a play tower/scratching post for cats. In fact, two familiar cat eyes appeared in the hole.

Puss's Voice: You should not be here, senior.

Shrek: Puss?

Suddenly, Puss's lower half started squeezing out, only something was different about it: it was bigger and more round. The cat grunted and squeezed out of the hole, finally revealing what he looked like in this world: a tubby orange cat, currently wearing nothing but a bow around his neck.

Shrek: (frowns) You’ve gotta be kidding me.

The orange cat slid down the scratching post very slowly and plopped onto a purple pillow at the foot of the tower. He struggled a bit to get up, but he eventually sat up and gave his usual glare towards foes.

Puss: Feed me, if you dare.

Shrek: (sets basket down) Puss, what happened to you? You got so fa…

The orange cat glared, knowing he was about to say the obvious word.

Shrek: Fa…fancy.

Puss: Do I know you?

Shrek: Well, where’s your hat? Where’s your belt? Your wee little boots?

Puss: (gets off pillow) Boots? For a cat? Ha!

He groaned while getting up and staggering toward some cream bottles and a bowl.

Shrek: But you’re Puss in Boots.

Puss: (pops lid off bottle)  Maybe once, but that is a name I have outgrown.

Shrek: That’s not the only thing you’ve outgrown.

Puss:(  pours cream into bowl and sets the bottle down ) Hey! I may have let myself go a little since retirement, but hanging up my sword was the best decision of my life. I have all the cream I can drink and all the mice I can chase.

A mouse appeared, licking from the bowl and the cat glanced at it.

Puss: Eh, I’ll get him later.

He licked from the bowl, which he was apparently sharing with the mouse. Shrek put his hands on the sides of his head in dismay.

Shrek: Puss, what have I done to you? You’ve gone soft.

The orange cat went back to his pillow.

Puss: (yawns) Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

He laid back in relaxation.

Shrek: Look, it’s not too late to fix it. All you have to do is help me get a kiss from Fiona.

At this time, Fiona came back and was not happy to see Shrek inside her tent without permission.

Fiona: What are you doing?

Shrek: (turns around) Hey!

Fiona: Can I help you with something?

Shrek: Well, I know how stressful mounting a rebellion can be, rallying the troops, planning attacks and all that, so I brought you a little something to ease the tension.

He held up the gift basket, but she didn't seem impressed.

Fiona: A gift basket?

Shrek: You’re welcome. So let’s see what you got.

He then got out each different gift from the basket.

Shrek: Heart-shaped box of slugs. A skunk-scented candle.

He sniffed the candle.

Shrek: Mmm.

Fiona: Look, this really isn’t the…

Shrek: What’s this? (holds out a homemade coupon book) Coupons! Let’s see, "Good for one free foot massage." "A mud facial!" Oh, and here’s one.

He came to one that had a childish drawing of his face on it.

Shrek: "Good for one free kiss." Let’s cash it now.

Fiona: Look, I don’t know what this is all about, but I’m trying to run a revolution. So unless you have Rumpelstiltskin’s head in there, I suggest you take your gift basket, get out of my tent and go make yourself useful! Wow.

Shrek: Wow. You’re right. I am sorry. I was just trying to be friendly. (holds out hand) No hard feelings?

Fiona decided to shake his hand.

Shrek: An apologetic hug?

The two hugged.

Shrek: And a quick kiss goodbye.

Fiona: Hey!

She quickly stopped him, grabbed his arm and placed it behind his back, forcing him to leave.

Shrek: Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

He was then thrown out of the tent on his back before Donkey came to him with a grin.

Donkey: Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do they make people feel uncomfortable?

Back inside the tent,

Fiona: Where’d we find that guy?

Puss, meanwhile, looked at his own reflection in the shield, and thought about the little talk between him and Shrek.

Puss: Could it be true? Have the years of prim and pampery made me soft?

Fiona then got out a comb and crush.

Fiona: Don’t be silly. Now who’s a pretty kitty?

Puss: (gives cute pose) I am.

Back at the palace, the three pigs were busy taking care of Fifi, and they were disgusted with doing so. Heimlich was in charge of scrubbing the goose's teeth (yes, goose don't normally have teeth, but this one does apparently), Horst was in charge of trimming her toenails, and Dieter was in charge of scrubbing her with a big soap brush and he plunged the brush into the suds bowl in annoyance. Rumpelstiltskin came over to his giant pet and cuddled her by the head.

Rumpelstiltskin: Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

He carressed her a bit, as she honked.

Rumpelstiltskin: Honk.

He then turned to the pigs with a scowl.

Rumpelstiltskin: All right, Piggies, be gone! Don’t forget to take her little potty box with you.

Dieter and Heimlich then carried the potty box away in disgust, with Horst following and spraying some perfume to drown any odors. Fifi then snipped Horst in the curly tail, making him yelp.

Horst: (whines) This little piggy wants to go home!

When the pigs were gone, a witch named Griselda came running in.

Griselda: Mr. Stiltskin! He’s here.

Rumpelstiltskin sat back on his throne with a couple other witches at his side.

Rumpelstiltskin: Nice.

The bounty hunter then came in through the doors, playing a flute, and he was approaching the throne, but not using his arms and legs to do so. Instead, he used a magic flute to make a small pack of mice carrying him all the way on their backs. Once the bounty hunter was revealed in front of the dictator and witches, the mice scampered off. He was in fact the Pied Piper.

Rumpelstiltskin: Pied Piper. How was your commute?

Instead of speaking, the piper communicated by playing a few notes.

Rumpelstiltskin: Good.

Griselda: (scoffs) You call this guy a bounty hunter? What’s he gonna do, (motions flute playing) flute those ogres a lullaby?

She and the other three witches chortled, while Rumpelstiltskin gave a nod to the piper, who nodded back, and then he turned the setting on the end of his flute from mouse to duck to witch. He then started playing a new song on the flute while beatboxing, and to the surprise of the witches, Griselda's arms began moving by themselves. Then she yelped as she started involuntarily breakdancing to the song, which is "Sure Shot" by the Beastie Boys, and the other two witches involuntarily got up and started dancing against their will as well, yelling in alarm.

Griselda: OK, got it! Make it stop!

Rumpelstiltskin just laughed at this, enjoying it. The dancing and song lasted for a bit, before the dictator got up, waving his arms.

Rumpelstiltskin: All right, that’s enough.

With that, the witches' dancing halted, ending with involuntary dancer poses as the three panted, and the piper ended his tune. Rumpelstiltskin gave an evil look.

Rumpelstiltskin: Looks like it’s time to pay the piper.

The witches still stood where they were.

Rumpelstiltskin: Griselda, seriously, it’s time to pay the piper. Now go get my checkbook!

The two witches left and Griselda got up to get the checkbook, but the impatient Rumpelstiltskin kicked her rear.

Rumpelstiltskin: Go! Move! Get out! Things are getting real sloppy around here!

The piper then switched the setting from witch to unicorn to his commissioned setting: ogre.

Back at the resistance camp, Shrek had been put to kitchen duties by Cookie. He was now wearing a hair net (despite the fact he had no hair) and a smock. Cookie handed Shrek a bowl of the usual food ogres eat.

Cookie: Here, now make sure they eat up! You can’t end tyranny on an empty stomach! (pushes Shrek out) Go on! (smacks him in the rear) Go!

So Shrek went to the other dining ogres as Cookie called out to them.

Cookie: Din-din!

The ogres cheered, ready for some grub. Shrek poured some eyeballs into one ogre's bowl. One other ogre slurped up a snake like a spaghetti noodle, another ate cockroaches and onions straight off a shish kabob stick, another chomped into a worm burger (with some remaining roaches scattering all over him), and one more ogre slurped up a whole string of snails attached together. Donkey was at one of the tables with the ogres, surprisingly not as dinner but as a guest.

Ogre #5: Come on, Donkey. One more time, please?

Donkey: All right, but this is the last time.

Shrek stopped just to take a glance at what Donkey was doing. Donkey dunked his snout into a bowl of eyeballs.

Brogan: Here it comes. Look at him.

He raised his head back up, closed his eyes and then let out a snort, causing two eyeballs (the ones from the bowl, not his own) to pop out of his nostrils. Shrek yelped in surprise and disgust, but the other ogres, on the other hand, all laughed heartily because they found the trick hilarious.

Donkey: I see you! (wags his tongue) Ah la la la la!

The ogres (minus Shrek) continued laughing hysterically.

Donkey: (singing) These eyes have seen a lot of loves But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you

Brogan then spoke to Shrek.

Brogan: That’s quite a friend you’ve got there. I can see why you haven’t eaten him.

Donkey: (wags his tongue again) Ah la la la la!

Shrek chose this time to set down next to Donkey.

Shrek: Donkey! (as Donkey opens his real eyes) I hate to pull you away from your adoring public, but I’m not getting anywhere with Fiona.

Shrek then pulled the trick eyeballs out of Donkey's nostrils.

Shrek: I need your help!

Cookie: Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

Shrek saw that Cookie had one of his gifts for Fiona and threw it onto the table. The ogres were eager for it as they chattered each wanting a piece of it, they took everything, from the lid to the slugs inside. They even eagerly ripped the box itself, leaving nothing but the heart-shaped base at the bottom, which was ripped in half, looking ironically like a broken heart, to Shrek's dismay.

Ogre #3: Where’d you get these?

Cookie: Fiona’s garbage. Just another gift from some clueless lover boy.

The ogres (minus Shrek) all laughed, and even Donkey couldn't help but giggle.

Donkey: That’s a good one, Cookie!

Then he got a glare from Shrek, making him stop giggling.

Ogre #3: Anyone who knows Fiona knows this stuff ain’t gonna work on her.

Gretched: (takes one of the slugs and eats it) Works on me.

The resistance ogres laughed a bit some more.

Shrek: Donkey, what am I gonna do? It’s like I don’t even know her.

Donkey: You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing Fiona cares about is her cause.

Brogan: (raises fist) To the cause!

Ogres (minus Shrek): (raising their fists) To the cause!

They cheered a bit, before continuing their eating.

Donkey: All right!

Then Shrek had an epiphany, knowing the only way he could possibly get close to this world's Fiona in order to save himself.

In Fiona's tent, the resistance leader herself was practicing witch-striking while blindfolded, waiting for any witches to strike. A cardboard witch dummy popped up from a corner and she threw a spinning axe at it, directly chopping through the dummy's head. Then another witch dummy came sliding down a pulley, and the blindfolded Fiona chucked another axe at it, directly hitting it and cutting it in half. Then she heard the sound of a dummy of a witch on a cage wagon creeping in the distance, as well as another dummy witch popping up in front. She used her foot to spring a spear up off the ground, take the spear and throw it like a javelin at the dummy, knocking it off and hitting the witch-on-cage dummy as well. The spear sent both dummies smack dab onto a tree. Shrek then appeared, wearing a helmet and iron bracelets around his wrists.

Shrek: Hello!

She sprung her axe and got ready to swing it, and as it got near Shrek's head, he screamed a bit. Fiona lifted her blindfold to see who it was.

Shrek: (smirks) Nice moves.

Fiona: (removes her blindfold) What are you doing?

Shrek: What does it look like? I’m getting ready for ambush action. Oh, yeah. I always like to quad my lutes and do some scrunches before an operational…op.

He picked out a spiky tool from a nearby weapon bucket.

Shrek: This one taken?

Fiona: We use that to clean the toilets.

He got out another weapon.

Fiona: And we use that one to clean the thing we clean the toilets with.

Shrek: I knew that.

He then got out an axe.

Fiona: There you go, chief.

Then, to the ogre's surprise, the axe was part mace. He chuckled a bit, swinging it around before the axe part snapped off the chain and spun towards a witch dummy, landing smackdab in the head's center. He chuckled a bit again, impressed by the accidentally successful hit, but then when he leaned on the weapon bucket, he knocked it over. He tried picking it up, but he ended up knocking some witch dummies and more stuff over, yelping in the progress. The noises woke up Puss, who was sleeping on an upper ledge.

Fiona: Hey, uh, Scott?

Shrek: My name is Shrek, actually.

Fiona: You’re going to get yourself killed at the ambush tonight.

Shrek: (gets up) I’ll be fine. I think I can take care of myself.

Then, without warning, she threw a shield against him as a song began to play.

Fiona: (smirks) Well, let’s see about that.

She then started to assault him with a huge hammer, which he used his shield to block. This was some type of training.

Shrek: Hey!

Golden leaves looked brown to me

She continued trying to hit him as he blocked her with the shield.

Shrek: Hey, hey! What the…?

The world had less color without you

He then spotted a spiky club lying on the ground. He took it used it to attack Fiona back, hitting her shield hard and sending her down. She blocked herself, and it appeared that she was whimpering, to Shrek's concern.

Shrek: Fiona?

Of course, she was faking it as she got back up and smacked Shrek with her weapon.

Fiona: Ha-ha!

Shapes in the sky look plain to my eyes

The two ogres then started attacking/blocking each other for a few moments, until Fiona kicked Shrek to the wall, hitting a dummy with a gourd for a head.

The world had less color without you

Shrek got back up and hit Fiona's shield with his axe, then Fiona hit Shrek with a big log, which he blocked with his shield. Then Shrek grabbed a huge mace to strike Fiona with, which she blocked. Shrek was enjoying this practice, but then his eyes widened upon seeing Fiona with a huge uprooted tree. She whacked Shrek, sending him down, and both ogres laughed.

Without you

Shrek got out and the next thing you know, both ogres started punching each other.

I know plenty of people with eyes closed

They kept on punching until Shrek stopped Fiona's fists, with the two breathing as they looked at each other. Puss was still watching and gave an amazed look at the chemistry between the ogres.

They don't see you like I do Darling I do

Then one of the bracelets fell off Shrek's wrist.

Fiona: I got it.

She picked it up.

Fiona: Give me your hand.

He gave her his hand and she started to retie it onto his wrist.

Fiona: The dragon goes under the bridge, through the loop and finally...

Shrek: Into the castle.

Fiona was surprised to find that Shrek knew the same tying rhyme as she did, and the two then gazed at each other.

I do Darling I do Darling I do

Puss: Wow.

See you

Then Fiona shook the feeling out of her.

Fiona: OK. Good. It seems like you can handle yourself.

Shrek: But, Fiona--

Fiona: Now go get ready for the mission!

Shrek: I will, but Fiona…

Fiona: That’s an order!

She headed off to get ready herself, and Shrek tried to speak out, but didn't know what to say, and looked down, for he had once again failed to get a kiss from her. So as all ogres began preparing all their weapons, Shrek just walked through the camp dejectedly.

Brogan: All right, let's get those axes sharpened and weapons packed! Preparation is half the battle!

Then, Puss began running after the dejected ogre, breathing heavily.

Puss: Ogre! Un momento! Un momento! (pants) Ogre, ogre, un momento! Just give me a minute.

Shrek: Look, Puss, I'm a little pressed for time.

Puss: I am not believing what I have just witnessed. Back there, you and Fiona. There was a spark, a spark inside her heart I thought was long extinguished. It was as if, for one moment, Fiona had actually found her true love!

Shrek: I AM her true love. I ended her curse.

Hearing that surprised Puss.

Puss: You know of her curse?

Shrek: By day, one way, by night another.

(Flashback)

We see a flashback of Fiona, in her human form, in the tower, shedding some tears as the sun was going down. She then laid down, and in a flash, she magically transformed into her ogre form, as part of the spell, and she lay there sorrowfully.

Shrek's Voice: This shall be the norm. Until you find true love's first kiss, and then take love's true form.

(End of Flashback)

Puss gasped, stunned at the words Shrek said.

Puss: You even know the little rhyme! It is true! You are the one! You must prove it to her!

Shrek: How?

Puss: Convince her! Go to her when she is alone and tell her something that only her true love would know.

Then Donkey just popped up out of nowhere.

Donkey: Know about what?!

The fat orange cat screeched from being startled, and hissed at the donkey.

Donkey: Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty! Shrek, can we keep him?

At Rumpelstiltskin's castle, the gate opened with some of the witches coming out, holding lanterns, followed by the carriage pulled by Fifi. At this time, Fiona was leading the ogres, all clad in armor, through the forest to be ready for the ambush. Shrek was trying to make his way through the ogre army though.

Shrek: Excuse me. Coming through! Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

Bringing up the rear, Puss, riding a small cart pulled by Donkey, spotted Cookie's chimichanga cart up ahead.

Puss: Look, Donkey, the chimichanga cart! Quick! (bouncing on Donkey's back) Andale! After him, burro! Donkey, vmonos!

Donkey: (annoyed) Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

Puss: And you are ri-donkey-lous!

Then both shortly paused before they bursted out laughing, not helping but finding both their puns funny. Then once the army came to the edge of the forest, Fiona signaled them to stop.

Fiona: I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

She went up ahead, and the other ogres, except Shrek obviously, went to take positions to hide. Fiona saw a nearby hanging tree branch, grabbed it and swung over it, landing on a higher hill.

Brogan: Secure your positions!

The ogres then climbed up some trees, and others donned disguises of bushes and rocks, taking their hiding positions. Fiona then came to the top of a slope where the carriage should be arriving. Shrek then appeared right beside her.

Shrek: It's quite a view from up here.

Fiona: What are you doing?! Get back in position!

Shrek: You need to know, once and for all, who I really am.

Fiona: You are going to ruin everything!

Shrek: Ruin everything? Actually, I'm gonna fix everything: the ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

Her eyes widened in shock, before she pulled out her dagger and held it closely towards Shrek's chin.

Fiona: How do you know about my curse?!

Shrek: OK, OK, please, Fiona. Just hear me out. I can explain everything.

Meanwhile, because of Shrek distracting her, neither of the two saw the carriage and witches, who were flying on their broomsticks, arriving this way. The ogres were still awaiting Fiona's signal.

Brogan: Where's Fiona's signal?

Gretched: What's she waiting for?

Cookie: He's going to get away!

Brogan: No, he's not.

He then gave a signal to one of the ogres in one of the trees. That ogre nodded, pulling the rope, which two of the witches flew into, knocking them off their brooms. The ogre army then yelled as they charged at the carriage, taking down some more witches along the way, and then ripping the carriage apart, chunk by chunk. However, to their surprise and confusion, Rumpelstiltskin was not there. Then Fifi, who looked more wooden than real, let out a flute-like squeak rather than a honk, to the ogres' notice. Then they saw "Fifi" come apart, revealing to be the Pied Piper in a wooden Fifi disguise. He whipped out his flute halves, placing them together, and beginning to play it.

Back with Shrek and Fiona, the latter threw the former down, threatening him with the dagger.

Fiona: Listen, I don't know who you are or how you know about my curse, but if any of these ogres find out I'm...

Shrek: A beautiful princess?

Fiona: That is not who I am! Not anymore.

Shrek: Look, I know you're upset.

Fiona: You don't know anything about me.

Shrek: I know everything about you. I know you sing so beautifully that birds explode.

Fiona: Big deal.

Shrek: I know that when you sign your name, you put a heart over the "I".

Fiona: So what?

Shrek: I know that when you see a shooting star, you cross your fingers on both hands, squinch up your nose and you make a wish.

Hearing that, her expression of anger faded away as she let him go. He got up as he continued.

Shrek: I know that you don't like the covers wrapped around your feet, and I know that you sleep by candlelight because every time you close your eyes...you're afraid you're gonna wake up back in that tower.

Fiona was amazed that he actually knew her more than she thought, and he looked at her tenderly.

Shrek: But, most importantly, Fiona...I know that the reason you turn human every day is because you've never been kissed....well...by me.

The two then joined hands together, and suddenly, from the distance, flute music was heard, and suddenly, Fiona grabbed the yelping Shrek, dipping him like in a dance.

Shrek: You move fast.

Fiona: It's not me doing the moving.

Then the two involuntarily got back up, holding their arms out. As the music picked up, the two held each others' hands and started dancing away from the hill.

Fiona: Why is this happening?!

Shrek: Love?

Fiona: No, I'm being forced to dance!

Shrek: By love!

Fiona: No, I can't stop myself!

Where the rest of the ogres were, they all began dancing unwillingly, as the Piper was playing a flute-beatbox version of "Shake Your Groove Thing" by Peaches & Herb. Brogan was panicking as he continued dancing under the flute's power.

Brogan: Please! Make it stop! I can't control myself!

Cookie, on the other hand, was getting jiggy with the dance spell.

Cookie: Ooh yeah! Cookie's bringing the heat out of the kitchen!

He put his hand to his side, making a sizzle sound. Shrek and Fiona danced near the ogre army, and ended up in the center of them, with Fiona spotting the Piper.

Fiona: Oh, no! It's the Piper! I can't believe I let this happen, and it's all because of you!

Shrek: If you'd just let me kiss you!

Fiona: What? You're insane!

Then Shrek involuntarily picked up Fiona in his arms and tossed her the air, with the ogres unwillingly tossing their shields up, giving some sort of atmosphere with Fiona in the air. Fiona then landed back down in Shrek's arms, as all the ogres continued dancing in a line and pointing their fingers like in a disco dance, under the Piper's musical spell. Puss and Donkey, still unaffected by the spell (because the setting was only to ogre), saw this and Puss was concerned while Donkey was bobbing along to the flute-beatboxing.

Puss: We must do something before they fandango themselves into oblivion!

Donkey: What can we do?

Puss: First, you must stop dancing!

Donkey: When somebody tooties that fluty, I got to shake my booty!

Puss: Then it's up to me!

He got out his claws and clawed Donkey's rear, making him scream and neigh like a horse, oddly enough for some reason, as he began racing down the hill and toward the line of dancing ogres. Donkey knocked Shrek and Fiona out of the line and onto the cart, racing away. Despite them being away from the Piper, the two ogres still pointed their fingers out like in a disco dance.

Puss: Hurry! We must get them away from the music!

Donkey: Puss and Donkey to the rescue! We saved the day!

Of course, he spoke too soon, as he didn't look to see they were heading for a chasm, and he didn't stop at the edge in time, resulting in the four to be sent falling into the chasm, screaming, before splashing into the water below.

A bit later, the four managed to reach dry land, recovering from the crash and splash. Shrek tried to fit one of the bracelets back on one his wrists, and it did because it didn't rust when hitting the water. Fiona just sighed in annoyance however. Puss tried to lick himself clean, but due to his ball-like girth, he could not reach his back half. He then turned to the drenched donkey, who was licking himself.

Puss: Donkey, can I borrow your tongue?

Donkey: (stops licking himself) Say what?! Nuh-uh! No. Hell...

The orange fat cat started doing his 'big eyes' trick.

Donkey: I don't care how big your eyes get, player, it's not going down.

His eyes grew even bigger, until the groaning Donkey finally gave in.

Donkey: (in defeat) All right!

Donkey took a deep breath and stuck his tongue out, ready to lick the cat, though he was disgusted to do so.

Shrek: Stop!

He saw Fiona heading up the path to a bridge and holding the lantern, with Shrek following.

Shrek: Where are you going?

Fiona: To save my friends.

Shrek: How? By getting yourself killed?

Fiona: If that's what it takes.

Shrek: Puss, say something.

Fiona: (turns) Puss?

Puss: (stammers) Let me explain.

Fiona: That's how you knew so much about me.

She continued to storm away and cross the bridge above.

Shrek: (hops onto the bridge) Fiona, wait! Kiss me.

Fiona: What?

Shrek: It's the only way to save your friends.

Fiona: (shoves him) Get out of my way.

Shrek: You used to believe that a single kiss could solve everything!

The female ogre then stopped in her tracks and turned, thinking that he would not be able to take a hint any other way. So he went up towards him, grabbed him and gave him a kiss, and the night background changed to a glowing background of yellow, and for a minute, it looked like everything would revert to normal, but alas, it did not. When the kiss ended and Shrek opened his eyes, everything about the alternate world was all as it was, including Fiona, frowning bitterly as she wiped her lip. Even Puss and Donkey were puzzled at how everything was the same.

Shrek: I don't understand. This doesn't make any sense. True love's kiss was supposed to fix everything!

Fiona: Yeah, you know, that's what they told me, too. True love didn't get me out of that tower. I did. I saved myself. Don't you get it? It's all just a big fairy tale.

Shrek: Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

Fiona: How would you know? Did you grow up locked away in a dragon's keep? Did you live all alone in a miserable tower? Did you cry yourself to sleep every night, waiting for a true love that never came?!

Shrek: But...but I'M your true love.

Fiona: Then where were you when I needed you?

She then picked up her lantern, leaving the three alone on the bridge, to rescue her friends herself. Shrek just stood there, completely heartbroken, knowing now that all his chances of ever getting a kiss from Fiona and saving his own life are gone.

Donkey: Maybe you kissed her wrong?

Shrek: (sadly) No. The kiss didn't work...because Fiona doesn't love me.

Inside the castle, all the ogres were yelling as they were now in cages dangling from the ceiling.

Brogan: Don't despair, fellow ogres! They can put us in cages, but they can't cage our honour!

Down below, the Piper was flute-speaking frantically to Rumpelstiltskin, explaining the situation, and the villain was furious.

Rumpelstiltskin: (furiously) SHREK AND FIONA ARE TOGETHER?!

He frantically flute-spoke some more.

Rumpelstiltskin: Yeah, I've heard enough of your (stomping his feet in rage) toot-a-lee-toots! YOU BLEW IT!

He then turned to Wolf.

Rumpelstiltskin: Wolfie! My speech wig. (to Baba) Baba!

She squeaked, stammered and stood up straight.

Rumpelstiltskin: Ready my makeup. (to the Piper) And Piper, pull my socks up.

He set the setting to socks and played his flute so Rumpelstiltskin's socks could be slithered up his legs tight like magic.

Rumpelstiltskin: Wee tight.

Then, somewhere in a market place, the Magic Mirror's face appeared in a mirror hanging in a shop (along with other mirrors pretty much anywhere in the kingdom).

Magic Mirror: Attention, citizens.

Some citizens, including the Muffin Man and one of the dwarves, who was digging in a trash barrell for scraps, turned their attention to the mirror in the shop.

Magic Mirror: Please stay tuned for a message from our tyrannical dictator!

The mirror's face disappeared and then there stood Rumpelstiltskin, in another powdered wig, in front of a beachside sunset background.

Rumpelstiltskin: (speaking gentle-like) Hello, people. (doing a curtsey) It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...shepherd of your dreams.

We then see him in a fake fern field, helping a little bird (which was also fake, obviously) fly away. When watching this, one citizen coughed. Next, Rumpelstiltskin slid backwards down a rainbow while on his back.

Rumpelstiltskin: Recently, a certain somebody has jeopardized our joyous lives.

The scenery changed to a fiery background.

Rumpelstiltskin: (angrily) And that somebody is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

On mentioning the name, a picture of Shrek with Donkey appeared right next to him. Then, the scene changed to a scenery of angels behind him.

Rumpelstiltskin: (calmly again) That is why I come to you, dear citizens. For whomever brings me this ogre, shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

He waved his hands, and a contract labeled "Deal of a Lifetime" appeared in front of him. Then, as "Orinoco Flow" by Enya played in the background, Rumpelstiltskin appeared on top of a mountain.

Rumpelstiltskin: Just think of it! Total and complete happiness.

Since this message appeared on all magic mirrors, it even appeared on a mirror that the three pigs, with the potty box, broom, and soap tub, were nearby, happened to see this as well. Even the Wolf, pushing the wig cart, saw this. The four were more than interested in getting the deal and not having to put up with Rumpelstiltskin anymore.

Heimlich: Ja!

We now see the dictator's head spinning with gold coins raining in the background.

Rumpelstiltskin: Dazzling, radiant fulfilment! All your greatest wishes.

Gingy and his animal crackers saw this on the mirror, and the gingerbread man was interested as well.

Gingy: (breaks his candy cane in half) Yeah!

The deal maker appeared, sitting on a goose's back, next to a beachside.

Rumpelstiltskin: Your wildest dreams.

Next, he was in front of a painting of his castle with fireworks shooting.

Rumpelstiltskin: Anything you could ever want! No strings attached!

Pinocchio, who was tangled upside-down in ropes and sleeping, heard this commercial and was interested as well.

Pinocchio: Ooooh.

Then, the dictator appeared next to a big hourglass.

Rumpelstiltskin: But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

The final scenery we see is Rumpelstiltskin's angry face in front of a painting of a burning city.

Rumpelstiltskin: So light your torches, sharpen your pitchforks and get your mob on!

The message got through to all citizens of Far Far Away as they all got their pitchforks and torches and began storming through the kingdom to hunt down Shrek, capture him and get their reward.

Mob: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

Mob Member: Go back where you came from!

The mob passed a brick wall. If they had stayed a little longer, they would have seen Shrek, Donkey, and Puss come out of hiding.

Puss: It seems that we are safe.

Donkey: Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky and torchy out there. Let's go.

Shrek: What's the point? The kiss didn't work. It's over.

Donkey: Look, Shrek, I know things might seem a little bleak right now, but things always work themselves out in the end, you'll see.

The ogre slapped his forehead.

Donkey: I bet by this time tomorrow...

He couldn't hold it in any longer, so he finally started to shout.

Shrek: Don't you understand? There is no tomorrow. There's no day after that, and there's no day after THAT day after that! My life was perfect and I'm never going to get it back!

Donkey: If your life was so perfect, why'd you sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

Shrek: Because I didn't know what I had until it was gone! All right?

He sighed sadly.

Shrek: I didn't know what I had.

He looked like he was about to cry, but then he felt something and heard tiny shouting. He looked down and saw Gingy hitting and attacking his feet with his lollipop.

Gingy: Ha! Chah! Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

Of course, Shrek was not affected by this at all. He just stood there with a dry look as Gingy kept attacking and shouting.

Gingy: Don't try to fight it, ogre! The reward is mine!

Shrek: Gingy?

He picked the gingerbread man up.

Gingy: You unhand me, green devil!

Shrek: What are you doing?

Gingy: Collecting my bounty!

Puss: Bounty?

Donkey: What are you talking about, cracker?

Gingy: Rumpelstiltskin promised the deal of a lifetime for whoever could bring you in.

Shrek: Deal of a lifetime?

Gingy: (down) Where all your wishes come true.

The ogre pondered this for a bit.

Shrek: Wait a minute. (grins) I can still fix this.

Donkey: Now, how you gonna do that?

He then set Gingy down.

Shrek: You know what? I'm gonna give Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants. (turns to Gingy) OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

But to his surprise, there were only crumbs and a gumdrop button on the ground. He looked and saw Puss eating something, and it was apparently Gingy. The cat noticed the ogre looking at him, and gave a sheepish look.

Puss: Were you going to eat that?

Inside the castle, the citizens came with prisoners of theirs, and none of them were Shrek, as the dictator pointed out while pacing and inspecting each one. One citizen even brought in a bag of flour with a scary green face painted on it.

Rumpelstiltskin: Not Shrek! That is not Shrek! Also not Shrek!

He then saw Butter Pants and his father with a big green creature they captured.

Rumpelstiltskin: That's not even an ogre, it is a troll! Nice try. (sees next one) And that...

What he saw was Wolf wearing a Shrek head over his own, claiming to be captured by the pigs.

Wolf: (dryly) Roar.

Rumpelstiltskin: ...is just sad.

He then spotted Pinocchio with his father, dressed in Shrek's clothes and fake ogre ears, with his face painted green and hands tied by a rope that the puppet was holding.

Rumpelstiltskin: And what is that supposed to be?

Gepetto: I'm just a frightened old man.

Pinocchio: Don't listen to him! These ogres are crafty!

Rumpelstiltskin: That is your father painted green.

Pinocchio: No, it's Shrek! Honest!

Then his nose grew and hit Rumpelstiltskin in the face, making the deal maker shout in pain as he swatted it out of his face.

Rumpelstiltskin: (to a witch) Take them away!

The frustrated villain then went to his table.

Rumpelstiltskin: Can no one bring me Shrek?! Where is he? How hard can it be?!

He angrily pounded on his table like a two-year-old.

Rumpelstiltskin: I WANT HIM! I WANT HIM! I WANT HIM!

Then the door of the throne room slammed open, and the ogre he wants is there.

Shrek: Stiltskin!

Rumpelstiltskin jumped up and looked back, seeing Shrek wander through the aisles.

Shrek: I hear you're looking for me.

Rumpelstiltskin: All right! Finally! (calls out and looks around) Who turned him in? Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

Shrek: I do.

He took the 'deal of a lifetime' contract out of Rumpelstiltskin's hand.

Rumpelstiltskin: What? But--

Shrek: If I'm turning myself in, I get the deal of a lifetime.

He plucked a feather from Fifi and dipped in the magic ink jar.

Shrek: That means you have to give me anything I want.

The scared villain leaped onto the table, stopping him signing it.

Rumpelstiltskin: No, no, no! Only true love's kiss can break your contract! So if you thought you were just gonna (mimicks walking) doot-doot-doot in here and get your life back--

Shrek: I'm not here to get my life back.

Rumpelstiltskin: (with a glare) Then what DO you want?

Outside the castle, Donkey and Puss awaited before all ogres of the resistance magically appeared, one by one, an dropped from the sky. Donkey saw Gretched falling towards where Puss was, so he used his teeth to pull the cat out of the way.

Puss: The ogres. They are all free.

Of course, Donkey noticed that not ALL of them were free.

Donkey: But where is Shrek?

They all went up to the gates, knowing Shrek was still inside.

Puss: This is not good.

Back in the throne room, the villagers have left, and Rumpelstiltskin was leading Shrek, who had his hands shackled, to a dungeon room, with four witches encircling the prisoner and pointing their brooms at him.

Rumpelstiltskin: I don't know. Not much of a storybook ending. (mockingly) The noble Shrek turns himself in to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

Shrek: All that matters is that they're free, and Fiona is safe.

Rumpelstiltskin: Awww, I bet Fiona would be really touched to hear that, but, hey, I guess you can tell her yourself.

He and the cackling witches turned to reveal Fiona, shackled as well, struggling to get out.

Shrek: Fiona!

Both ogres rushed to each other, but the weight of the shackles and chains held them back. They tried breaking free from them to no avail, and Rumpelstiltskin only cackled maniacally as he watched the two ogres struggle to reach each other in failed attempts to his pure wicked amusement.

Shrek: Stiltskin, we had a deal! You agreed to free all ogres!

Rumpelstiltskin: (uncaring tone) Oh, yeah. (slyly) But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

He gave a smug, evil smirk. Shrek's face faltered as he looked over at Fiona worryingly.

Rumpelstiltskin: By day, one way, by night, another. Blardy, blardy, blar. Ha ha!

He skipped merrily out of the room in triumph.

Rumpelstiltskin: (triumphantly) Nobody's smart but me!

He and the laughing witches left the room, closing the doors and leaving the two prisoners alone. Shrek gave a solemn sad look.

Fiona: That was a really brave thing you did, Shrek. Thank you.

Shrek: No, you were right. I wasn't there for you. And not just at the Dragon's Keep, but...every day since.

Fiona: Well...(gives a small sad smile) you're here now.

Outside, Donkey was determined to get inside, but Gretched held him back by the tail.

Donkey: Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

Gretched: Don't be a fool, mule!

Brogan: She's right. Rumpel's palace is locked up tighter than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.

Cookie: And that cupboard wasn't guarded by a whole bunch of mean, ugly, nasty witches.

Of course, two witches guarding the palace from above, heard them.

Palace Witch #1: Hey! We can hear you!

Brogan: Sorry!

Then the ogres, Donkey and Puss huddled.

Puss: We must get into the palace.

Donkey: Man, Shrek and me just busted out of that place!

Brogan: But how?

Donkey then saw a shield, and it gave him an idea.

Donkey: The same way we're gonna bust in.

The group huddled in closer together, with the two palace guard witches curious, wondering what they're talking about. A while later, Rumpelstiltskin, with his speech wig back on for some reason (though it looked untidy), walked back in the throne room, as a witch was hoisting up what appeared to be a new big decorative ball like the one from earlier.

Rumpelstiltskin: Yay! My new pretty ball!

He noticed that something about this ball was different than the previous one.

Rumpelstiltskin: Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue? I guess it'll have to do.

Once the witches got it up, some other witches poured magic glowing dust in their cauldrons, causing bright, glowing, blue and pink lights to appear. They pointed their cauldrons like spotlights at the big ball, which began reflecting the bright colorful lights off like a disco ball.

Rumpelstiltskin: Witches, finally, the moment we've all been waiting for. The main event of the evening!

The floors under him began shifting, revealing something. It was Shrek and Fiona still bound in shackles and chained to the walls, with a spotlight shining down on them.

Rumpelstiltskin: I present Shrek and Fiona!

The prisoners looked up, both glaring at Rumpelstiltskin and the horde of witches up above peering down at them, and the witches all booed and jeered the ogres.

Rumpelstiltskin: And now, to put the past behind us once and for all, I give ya a princess's worst nightmare! Fiona's old flame, the keeper of the keep...

As he continued speaking, Shrek and Fiona saw a gate in the dungeon opening up and a familiar red dragon stormed in.

Rumpelstiltskin: Dragon!

She let out a huge roar and then started breathing fire. She stomped about, getting ready to finish her prisoners as Rumpelstiltskin laughed heartlessly, enjoying the ogres' soon-to-be demise. Then suddenly he and the witches heard a familiar voice singing from out of nowhere.

Donkey's Voice: (singing) Winter, spring, summer, or fall

They all gasped, looking up at the big ball, seeing Donkey at the top of it, singing.

Donkey: (singing) All you got to do is call And I'll be there, yeah, yeah

Dragon, who was nearing Shrek, turned her attention up to the ball.

Shrek: Donkey?

Donkey: And Puss!

On cue, though very slowly, Puss slid down the rope holding the ball, and this time, he was wearing his hat, cape and boots.

Puss: In Boots!

He tap danced a bit on top of the ball, and then from inside it, a humming noise was heard, to the witches' and Rumpelstiltskin's concern.

Rumpelstiltskin: What?

They all looked around to see where the noise was coming from, and the new ball suddenly broke open like a pinata and all the resistance ogres began flying out of it, yelling. The whole thing turned out to be a Trojan horse reenactment with the ogres using their shields to make it convincing. All the witches screamed as the ogres chased after them with their clubs and weapons, ready to clobber them. Brogan leaped out towards where Rumpelstiltskin was, making the dictator scream as he ran for it. Brogan rose his club, ready to strike the villain, but one of the witches flew by on her broomstick, scooping up her master and taking him to the higher balcony, dropping him there. Rumpelstiltskin jumped onto the railing and looked down at the chaos in horror. Puss and Donkey meanwhile saw Dragon returning her attention to the ogres, snarling like mad and ready to attack again, but Puss then cut the rope of the platform he and Donkey were on, sending them falling and screaming, but they landed on Dragon's head, knocking her down for the count. Rumpelstiltskin, still watching, grumbled and growled.

Rumpelstiltskin: Get them! Get them, witches!

So the witches on the balcony got out their pumpkin bombs and chucked them down to where all the resistance ogres were. They luckily saw the pumpkins about to be thrown.

Ogre: Incoming!

They all took their shields and blocked themselves with them, with the exploding pumpkins bouncing off and not blowing up one single ogre. The woozy Donkey got up on his legs.

Shrek: Donkey, woo her!

Donkey: Woo who?

Shrek: Your wife!

Speaking of whom, Dragon growled as she stomped behind the fear-stricken Donkey. He timidly turned, screaming a bit. Then suddenly the lights changed to blue as Donkey's fearful expression changed to a smooth charmer expression, with the donkey trying his best to woo the reptile, who's look of anger began to fade, as if the charm was working. Donkey then gave a grin, and Dragon batted her eyelashes lovingly. At this time, a certain Lionel Richie song played.

Hello Is it me you're looking for I can see it in your eyes

The two were about to kiss until Dragon's mouth opened wide around Donkey.

Donkey: Uh oh.

Then in one chomp, Donkey ended up in her mouth. Puss then leaped onto the dragon's spine, grabbed his sword and jabbed it right into the back, making the dragon roar and spit out Donkey, who was sent flying in the air.

Donkey: Wahoo!

He hitched a ride onto a passing witch's broomstick.

Donkey: (calls out to Dragon) I'll call you! (to the witch) We're in love!

Witch: Good for you.

Back below, the dragon spotted the fat cat and just as she tried to eat him, he leaped out of the way, shouting in excitement. He rode her tail, which she swished around like mad, hitting a wall where Shrek was, and the ogre ducked in time. Then Dragon flicked the screeching fat cat off her tail, and Fiona caught him in her arms. Fiona gasped, knowing Dragon was coming for them, so she turned away, getting ready for the blow and Dragon exhaled the biggest breath of flame from her mouth. After she breathed it, she then saw that Fiona and Puss were no longer there, then she spotted the ogre being lifted up by the chains, thanks to Shrek pulling on the chains with his wrists, and Puss was holding onto Fiona's back.

Shrek: Fiona, hold on! (to Dragon) Hey, you!

He then got Dragon chasing after him as he continued pulling on the chains.

Shrek: Whoa!

Then Shrek and Fiona ended up swinging around on both chains all around the room, and each time they got near Dragon's mouth, she tried to eat them, only to miss. Then both ogres each reached a dangling cage. Shrek reached out his hand, and Fiona swung a bit, taking his hand. Back above, witches kept launching skull chains at the ogres, pulling them up, though no matter how many skull chains ensnared Brogan, he did his best to resist. He even grabbed some of the chains and tossed some of the witches who had them down. Then, on the balcony, the short villain saw chimichangas being fired at some of the witches near him.

Rumpelstiltskin: Chimichangas?!

Down below, Cookie was launching the aforementioned sticky foods from his cart/catapult.

Cookie: Get 'em while they're hot!

He even launched one at the witch that Donkey was riding with. When the witch was knocked down by the snack, Donkey was impressed. Below in the dungeon, Shrek and Fiona made it the top of the middle dangling cage. They looked down, waiting for Dragon to leap out at them, and when she did, that was their chance.

Fiona: Jump!

They both leaped onto the separate cages, while Dragon got her snout stuck in the middle cage. They looked at each other while holding their chains.

Shrek: Now!

They both leaped off the cages, and started swinging around Dragon like acrobats.

Fiona: Woo-hoo!

As Dragon kept struggling to get the cage off her muzzle, the two ogres began wrapping the chains around the reptile, starting with her tail.

Shrek: The dragon goes under the bridge!

Fiona: Through the loop!

Shrek: And finally...

They then both reached the center of the dragon's back, finishing trussing her in chains.

Both: Into the castle!

They both tugged on the chains, and Dragon, bound in them, was sent tumbling down. Then Shrek and Fiona looked at the battle still going on above. The witches were screaming as the ogres were getting the better of them.

Palace Witch: Run!

Some witches ran and flew off on their brooms, screaming. On the balcony, Rumpelstiltskin saw that ogres were closing in on both sides where he was, giving him nowhere to run. He then made for the balcony's railing as the ogres had him cornered. He turned back towards them.

Rumpelstiltskin: Foo!

With that, he leaped off backwards, to the ogres' shock. Then they were surprised further to see the short foe riding on Fifi, who was flying upwards so they could make their escape.

Rumpelstiltskin: So long!

He laughed tauntingly as Fifi headed for the skylight, as dawn was approaching, but then a skull chain had snagged Fifi's leg, and Shrek was the one who was holding the chain.

Shrek: Ha ha ha!

Fiona and Shrek grabbed hold of each other.

Rumpelstiltskin: Come on, Fifi, go! Go!

Fifi tried to keep flying, pulling Shrek and Fiona out of the dungeon.

Rumpelstiltskin: Witches, close up the floor!

The floor began closing up, but Shrek and Fiona were pulled out just in time. Fifi tried to keep flying even though it was harder with the chain around her leg.

Rumpelstiltskin: (fussing) Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap! Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!

The smirking Shrek pulled the chain, causing Rumpelstiltskin to loose his grip on his goose, as he was sent falling and screaming.

Rumpelstiltskin: Fifi, no!

His fall was stopped when a glaring Fiona caught him, making him give a scared sound. Fiona then held up the short man like a trophy.

Fiona: Victory is ours!

All the ogres shouted and cheered in triumph, while raising their weapons. Donkey then started tapping his hooves with Puss doing a little victory tap dance, until at the end when the top of his boots began to split, to the fat cat's embarassment. Cookie then carried off the worried and defeated villain in his arm, as he and Brogan gave smirks towards him.

Brogan: Looks like we're having curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

When all was settled, Fiona and Shrek looked to each other.

Fiona: Hey, we make a pretty good team.

Shrek: You have no idea.

The two then looked at each other, staying silent for a moment, but then Shrek noticed something serious. His hand was started to give a bright yellow glow, making him gasp. He saw that morning was starting to happen, so that meant he was beginning to fade away. His legs also started glowing as he fell down.

Fiona: Shrek?

She held him up. They saw the magic hourglass of Shrek's life was almost out of sand, to Rumpelstiltskin's delight.

Rumpelstiltskin: His day is up. His day is...!

But Cookie squeezed him, making the villain gag.

Fiona: Shrek?

Shrek: It's all right.

The ogres, Donkey and Puss watched on sadly.

Fiona: There has to be something I can do.

Shrek: You've already done everything for me, Fiona. You gave me a home and a family.

Fiona: You have kids?

Shrek: We have kids. Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named...

Both: Felicia.

Fiona: I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.

Shrek: And someday...

The fading ogre then dug in his pocket and pulled out the squeaky toy belonging to their daughter.

Shrek: ...you will.

He handed it to her, and she looked at it sadly, before looking back towards him.

Shrek: You know what the best part of today was? I got the chance to fall in love with you all over again.

Tears began to form from Fiona's eyes as she leaned her head towards Shrek's face. The hour glass emptied and the light began to glow brightly all around Shrek's body as Fiona kissed him deeply, and then Shrek began to fade away into nothing but sparkles of golden dust that also began to fade away as Fiona held him. It seemed Shrek was no more. Then the sun rising behind Fiona began to shine brightly, illuminating the whole room as she sat there on her knees with tears running down her face, which was still green, to Puss's notice.

Puss: Fiona, the sunrise! You're still...an ogre!

Fiona: True love's form.

Rumpelstiltskin: Impossible!

Fiona: The kiss worked.

Suddenly the wind began blasting and brushing by everyone, also knocking Puss's hat off his head. Everyone looked up and saw the magic golden light that brought Shrek here begin to eat away at Rumpelstiltskin's castle like mad. All bricks, shingles and other material of the castle were sucked away in a magical tornado.

Rumpelstiltskin: What?!

Then, one by one, each witch and ogre began to puff away into puffs of yellow smoke. Cookie and Brogan quickly vanished, dropping Rumpelstiltskin, and he then saw Fifi vanish in a puff of smoke as well.

Rumpelstiltskin: Fifi!

Then Donkey and Puss were the next to vanish.

Fiona: Puss!

Then Fiona vanished next. The horrified Rumpelstiltskin, the only one remaining, twisted in circles in place while shouting in alarm as his whole world around him was tearing away and disappearing.

Rumpelstiltskin: No, no, no! No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait! (screaming)

Then the floor under him, the only thing remaining, crackled away and he began falling down into an abyss of pure golden light while screaming out loud in horror, before everything went black for him.

The world changed back to a different world where Shrek was giving his big, loud ogre roar from before.

Shrek: RROOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAR!!

Once he was done, he panted and saw where he was. He was back in his own original world and at his kids' birthday party, as if he never left it. It was as if the magic of true love's kiss reversed everything to the event where he roared. He saw that everyone else in the Candy Apple was left stunned and silent for a bit until they all cheered.

Butterpants: (chuckles as he hugs his dad) I love you, daddy.

As everyone began chanting Shrek's name, the ogre began to smile, happy to have his life back, and everyone he knew back to normal.

Everyone: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

Gingy saw one of the Three Blind Mice facing the other way so he turned the mouse around correctly.

Wolf then slapped a party hat onto Shrek's head.

Puss: Everybody, I have found...

He lifted his cape to reveal another cake decorated like the last one.

Puss: (finishes) another cake!

Fiona: Shrek? Are you okay?

He turned to see Fiona, the way she was before signing his life away. He removed the party hat and went up to hug his wife.

Shrek: Fiona. I've never been better.

Fiona smiled warmly, and the parents then heard their kids playfully roaring.

Fergus: Roar!

All triplets began roaring and giggling. Shrek was even happy to see his kids existing as he went to them.

Shrek: (rubs Farkle's head) Happy Birthday, Farkle. Fergus, my little man! And Felicia, sweetheart.

His baby daughter looked at him with big, happy, blue eyes. He then reached his pocket and handed her the squeaky ogre plush toy he magically came back into this world with.

Shrek: I believe this is yours.

She hugged the toy tightly.

Felicia: Thank you, Daddy.

Shrek: (picking up his kids and holding them) Awww.

Donkey: Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about giving my babies an encore!

Puss: Please, senior, let us have it!

The others insisted eagerly. However, instead of a roar, Shrek held his nose and blew a toot threw his ears. Then, all three of his babies held their noses and blew smaller toots through their ears. As their friends applauded and Puss waved a little yellow flag, Fiona was astounded.

Fiona: (holds Farkle) I didn't know we could do that.

Donkey: That's my best friend!

Shrek then looked towards Fiona.

Shrek: You know, I always thought that I rescued you from the Dragon's Keep.

Fiona: You did.

Shrek: No. It was you that rescued me.

The two smiled warmly before kissing with their babies hugging them, while everyone cheered. Then, the scene changed to a picture of the still scene in the final page of a book Shrek had out.

"The End"

We see Shrek's hand closing the book to his own story, before placing the book up on a shelf, but the story is not quite over just yet. Shrek then went outside of his house in the swamp as another party was going on, with a new cover of the song from his first film's ending playing. Also, the ogres from the resistance came as guests. Shrek held out a tray of mugs with swamp drinks for them and each took a glass, before two ogres took Shrek and tossed him up in the air.

I thought love was only true in fairy tales

Shrek laid on his back in the air happily.

"Mike Myers"

Fiona then caught him in her arms before the two smooched and chuckled.

Meant for someone else but not for me

Donkey then slid down Dragon's spine before she used her tail to flick him into her mouth. She closed it before opening it back up with Donkey's fur all fuzzy as it was in the alternate dimension, but he shook it off.

"Eddie Murphy"

Love was out to get me Do-do-do-do-do That's the way it seems Do-do-do-do-do

The other ogres tossed a big ball made of their shields in the air, and the Wolf and pigs used the reflection of light off the Magic Mirror to shine on the ball, and Fiona was on top of the outhouse, spinning the ball with her finger like a basketball and also like a disco ball.

Disappointment haunted all my dreams

"Cameron Diaz"

Then I saw her face Now I'm a believer

Puss then flipped in the air and slid across a deck, sliding his sword across it, causing sparks to appear and lighting the villagers' sparklers, making them laugh and cheer. Puss then stopped near a shield Cookie held and saw that it made Puss look bloated (like it did in the alternate dimension), making Puss concerned.

"Antonio Banderas"

And not a trace

Queen Lillian then danced with one of the resistance ogres, passing a memorial with a portrait of King Harold and all the frogs who attended his funeral, each with a drink in their flipper and bobbing along to the song.

Of doubt in my mind

"Julie Andrews"

The portrait of Harold's face was moving by itself, because most likely his ghost was taking its form, and gave a short smile.

"John Cleese"

I'm in love

Even Fifi was there, seeing a small bluebird, snapping at it, trying to eat it, but the bluebird landed on Shrek's finger, and Fiona sang a high note, making not only the bluebird puff up, but Fifi puff up as well.

I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

Then Rumpelstiltskin, in a round cage, turned away from this, as there was an explosion of white feathers. When he looked, he saw that both birds have exploded, and all that was left of Fifi was her webbed feet. Everyone was stunned at first before they burst out laughing, while the horrified Rumpelstiltskin couldn't help but grieve for the loss of his pet, but before he could, he began to dance unwillingly, due to the Pied Piper using his flute power on the captured villain while outside the cage.

"Walt Dohrn"

Then I saw her face Now I'm a believer

Everyone then cheered for the small concert being given to them by Brogan, Cookie and Gretched. Brogan and Gretched were on guitars, while Cookie was on the drums. Then the three held their noses and blew through their ears.

"Jon Hamm"

"Jane Lynch"

"Craig Robinson"

And not a trace Of doubt in my mind

Some of the witches, who were also there and not on Rumpelstiltskin's side in this world, began taking off on their broomsticks for a joyride, cheering and whooping. However, the fifth witch couldn't take off because her broom turned out to be Pinocchio's nose grown long. She looked at the puppet behind her and shook her head. The other four witches flew through the sky, and created a rainbow pattern with magic dust.

"Lake Bell" "Kathy Griffin" "Mary Kay Place" "Kristen Schaal"

Now I saw her face And I'm a believer

Three of the Dronkeys flew up, each one carrying one of Shrek's kids in the air, going for a joyride themselves. Even Butter Pants was riding a Dronkey himself.

Not a trace

At a stump, Gingy was riding an animal cracker horse, with the other animal crackers gathered around him.

Gingy: Yee-haw!

Of doubt in my mind

The Three Pigs appeared, not helping but find the animal crackers tasty.

Dieter: Yummy!

The pigs chowed down on all the animal crackers, leaving nothing but Gingy and his horse. Shrek and Fiona danced with each other before falling backwards in the mud.

I'm a believer, I'm a believer

Now the ogre couple, and pretty much everyone else, except Rumpelstiltskin, the Dronkeys and Dragon, were all making mud angels in the mud, laughing and enjoying themselves, as the Dronkeys flew up in the air.

I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer, I'm a believer!
